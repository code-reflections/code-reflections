to CodeReflections, a blog dedicated to exploring programming\nlanguages, tools, and best practices.  I'm looking forward to posting about\ntopics of interest to me, and I hope you find them interesting too!\n\nI've been wanting to create a blog like this for many years now, and finally\ngot around to doing it. Better late than never, right?\nSince this is an introductory post, I'll try to describe what to expect from\nthis blog.  Currently, I'm expecting that Perl and Rust will likely be the\nprimary focus of this blog, simply because both languages are of special\ninterest to me.  Of course, this may change over time, and I certainly won't\nhesitate to post about other topics of interest to me.  I've always been a\nprogramming polyglot, having used dozens of languages over the years, so\nanything goes!\nPerl has been my favorite programming language for well over 30 years now.\nWhile I can't pin down precisely when I started using Perl, my best estimate\nwould be sometime in 1989 or so.  I know for certain that I was using Perl in\nearly 1990, and by early 1991 it was my favorite programming language and an\nindispensable tool for me.  (There's a story there which I'll save for a future\nblog post.)\nRust is a more recent passion for me.  I started looking into Rust in 2019, and\nquickly became very interested.  I'll get into more detail later, but suffice\nit to say that apart from Raku (née Perl 6), Rust is the first language I've\nfound that feels like it has the potential to displace Perl as my favorite\nprogramming language.  It hasn't happened yet, but it's a distinct possibility.\nOne of my favorite quotes comes from Alan Kay: \"Simple things should be simple,\nand complex things should be possible.\"  This has always been my philosophy\nabout programming in general, so I made it the tagline for this blog.\nLately, I've been experimenting with ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by\nOpenAI.  It's a fascinating tool which is surprisingly capable and intelligent\non the one hand, yet surprisingly dumb or hallucinatory at times as well.  It\ncan be a very useful tool, but it should not be trusted blindly.  Still, it's\nnothing like conversations with Eliza back in the day; ChatGPT could probably\npass the Turing Test!\nIn the process of creating this blog, I've been using ChatGPT as a tool to help\nwith research, brainstorming and also just as a sounding board to bounce ideas\noff of.  (That's really an odd turn of phrase, isn't it?)  Consider this a\ndisclaimer that ChatGPT may be used as a tool when creating any of the content\non this blog, but rest assured that the thoughts and opinions here are my own.\nI won't hesitate to discard or rewrite anything ChatGPT suggests.\nFor example, I told ChatGPT to \"Help me write the first post for the blog.\"\nI wanted to see what it would come up with, and use it as a starting point to\nwork from.  For the sake of transparency, here is the exact draft that ChatGPT\ngave me in response:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHelp me write the first post for the blog.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTitle: Welcome to CodeReflections: A Journey in Programming\nHello, fellow programmers and tech enthusiasts! Welcome to CodeReflections, a\nblog dedicated to exploring programming languages, tools, and best practices.\nI'm thrilled to embark on this journey with you all, and I hope that together\nwe can learn, grow, and share our passion for programming.\nTo kick things off, let's talk about the purpose of this blog and what you\ncan expect to find here. CodeReflections is primarily focused on Perl and\nRust, two languages I personally love working with. However, as a programming\npolyglot, I won't limit the discussion to just these two languages. You can\nexpect to see content related to various programming languages, tools,\nlibraries, and techniques.\nAs Alan Kay once said, \"Simple things should be simple, and complex things\nshould be possible.\" This quote perfectly encapsulates the philosophy behind\nthis blog. I believe that good programming practices should enable us to make\nsimple tasks simple and give us the tools to tackle complex challenges when\nneeded.\nHere's what you can expect from CodeReflections:\nTutorials and Guides: Easy-to-follow explanations and practical examples to\nhelp you learn new concepts, tools, and libraries.\nCode Optimization: Tips and tricks for writing efficient, elegant, and\nmaintainable code.\nLanguage Comparisons: Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of different\nprogramming languages and how they can be utilized in various projects.\nBest Practices: Discussions on design patterns, testing methodologies, and\nother practices to help you become a better programmer.\nPersonal Insights: As I explore new languages, tools, and techniques, I'll\nshare my thoughts and experiences in hopes that they might resonate with you\nor spark a conversation.\nIn the spirit of open-source, I welcome contributions and discussions from\nthe community. If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions, feel free\nto leave a comment or reach out to me via social media.\nThank you for joining me on this adventure, and I look forward to our future\ndiscussions on CodeReflections.\nHappy coding!\n      \n    \n  \n\nPretty good, right?  Honestly, I don't disagree with anything above, but it\nstill sounds a bit generic to me.  As you can see, I've deviated quite a bit\nfrom this suggested draft.  While ChatGPT's suggestions sound fine to me\n(Tutorials and Guides, Code Optimization, Language Comparisons, Best Practices\nand Personal Insights), I don't know how accurate that list might be.  Time\nwill tell.\nI figure that I might as well explore reasonable monetization options for this\nblog.  I'm not going to hold my breath hoping to make a living as a blogger,\nbut every little bit helps, right?  It's worth a try, so I instructed ChatGPT:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAdd a paragraph with a suitable disclosure for possible monetization (e.g.\nads/affiliate links/sponsorships) and use of ChatGPT.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn the interest of transparency, I want to inform you that CodeReflections\nmay be monetized in the future through advertisements, affiliate links, and\nsponsorships. These monetization methods help support the creation and\nmaintenance of this blog. Any such content will always be clearly identified,\nand I promise to maintain a high standard of quality in my posts. Rest\nassured that my priority is to provide valuable and unbiased content to my\nreaders. Additionally, some of the content on this blog, including this post,\nhas been drafted with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model\ndeveloped by OpenAI. This tool aids me in generating ideas and refining the\ncontent, but the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSure, I guess this works.  No notes.\nThat's enough for now.  As ChatGPT said: Happy coding!\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/18/welcome-to-codereflections/","title":"Welcome to CodeReflections!"},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/":{"body":"How did I choose CodeReflections as the name for this blog?  With some help\nfrom ChatGPT!\nI always dread trying to think of a good name for a new project, because I'm\nmuch better at rejecting name ideas than thinking of one I actually like and\ncan use.  Having already decided to use ChatGPT as a tool to help with this\nblog, I figured it could help me brainstorm to find a good name for the blog.\nIt was a very long conversation with ChatGPT (GPT-4 model), but it was\nultimately successful.\n\nHere's how it went:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nI need to think of a good name for the blog.  I've been programming Perl since\n1989 and it's been my favorite language almost since the beginning, but I've\nbeen extremely interested in Rust for the last few years and it's the one\nlanguage (besides Perl 6/Raku) that feels like it could potentially take the\nplace of Perl as my favorite language.  (It hasn't yet, but it seems to have\nthe potential.)  Perl and Rust are the two languages I would be most likely to\nbe blogging about, although I've probably used dozens of different languages\nover the years.  Also, one of my favorite quotes is \"Simple things should be\nsimple, complex things should be possible.\"  (I'm sure you know who said that.)\nPerhaps it could be used as a tagline?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nBased on your interests and the quote you mentioned, here are some suggestions\nfor your blog name:\n\nPerlsOfRust.com - A play on the phrase \"pearls of wisdom\" that highlights\nyour expertise in both Perl and Rust.\nRustyPerlGuru.com - Combining your love for Perl and Rust while showcasing\nyour expertise.\nTwoLanguagesOnePassion.com - Emphasizing your passion for both Perl and\nRust.\nSimpleAndPossible.com - Derived from the quote you mentioned, focusing on\nthe simplicity and possibilities of Perl and Rust.\nustyPerlsOfWisdom.com - A combination of the play on \"pearls of wisdom\" and\nyour interest in Rust.\nFromPerlToRust.com - Documenting your journey and experiences in both Perl\nand Rust.\nPerlandRustAdventures.com - Showcasing your adventures and experiences in\nthe world of Perl and Rust.\n\nFor the tagline, you can use the quote you mentioned, perhaps with a small\nadaptation:\n\"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible - Adventures\nin Perl and Rust\"\nRemember to check the availability of the domain names and make sure they are\nnot taken or trademarked by someone else.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nA name that works well for Perl and Rust would be good but I don't necessarily\nwant to bind the name too closely to either language in case my interests\nchange or the focus of the blog changes.  Something related somehow to that\nquote might work better.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nUnderstood. Here are some more blog name suggestions that are inspired by the\nquote and not tied directly to Perl or Rust, allowing for flexibility in your\ncontent:\n\nSimpleAndPossible.com - Directly derived from the quote, emphasizing\nsimplicity and possibility in programming.\nCodingElegance.com - A focus on elegant and efficient coding practices\nacross various languages.\nTheEfficientCoder.com - Highlighting your expertise in making simple and\ncomplex tasks possible in programming.\nCodeVersatility.com - A nod to your experience with numerous programming\nlanguages and ability to adapt.\nAgileSyntax.com - Combining the idea of simplicity with your adaptability\nacross multiple languages.\nTheFlexibleProgrammer.com - Emphasizing your ability to work with different\nlanguages and cater to a variety of projects.\n\nFor the tagline, you can still use the quote or a variation of it to emphasize\nyour core philosophy:\n\"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible - Exploring\nthe art of programming\"\nRemember to check domain availability and ensure that the names are not already\ntaken or trademarked.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nWho is that quote from?  I may also be interested in writing blog posts about\npersonal or political topics, but I'm thinking that should be in a completely\nseparate blog, no?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nThe quote \"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible\"\nis attributed to Alan Kay, a computer scientist known for his pioneering work\non object-oriented programming and the development of the Smalltalk programming\nlanguage.\nAs for writing about personal or political topics, it's generally a good idea\nto separate those from a technical programming blog. Keeping them separate\nallows you to maintain a focused theme for each blog, catering to the interests\nof different target audiences.\nYou can create a second blog for your personal and political posts and link it\nin your author bio or \"About\" page on your programming blog. This way, readers\nwho are interested in your non-technical thoughts can easily find your other\nblog without it distracting from the programming content.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nMakes sense.  I always struggle with coming up with good names for projects.\nGive me a large list of additional suggestions.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nCertainly!

Here's my thoughts\non using various names you've suggested:\n\nSimpleAndPossible.com - Too obvious.\nCodingElegance.com - Not bad I guess, but it seems to have the potential to\ncome across as arrogant.  Also, a domain squatter owns that domain.\nTheEfficientCoder.com - Nope, doesn't feel right.\nCodeVersatility.com - Sounds almost too generic.\nAgileSyntax.com - Nothing wrong with agile programming, though it won't\nnecessarily be a focus.  Combining it with \"syntax\" just sounds weird though.\nTheFlexibleProgrammer.com - Meh.  Flexibility is good though.\n\nFrom the next list:\n\nCodeSimplicity.com - On the fence about this one, but I like the concept\nagain.\nElegantSolutions.dev - Again, I like the concepts of elegance and solving\nproblems, but this again seems potentially arrogant-sounding as well.\nComplexityMadeSimple.com - I like the connection to the quote, and the idea\nof the blog being able to help readers grasp complex things and make them\nsimple, but this name still doesn't work for me.\nTheAdaptableCoder.com - I'm not sure I want to refer to myself as\n\"Programmer\" or \"Coder\" for the name because I don't want the blog to be about\nme, per se.  Adaptability is a good concept though.\nInfiniteCodingPossibilities.com - Nice idea, still not working for me.\nCodeAlchemy.io - Nope.\nEffortlessProgramming.com - No, good programming often does require\nsignificant effort.\nFluidCodeSolutions.com - Nope, but good ideas.\nUniversalCoder.net - Interesting, but no.\nPolyglotProgrammer.dev - I kinda like it and it does describe me, but\nagain, I'm not the focus of the blog.\nTheCodingPhilosopher.com - Hmm, I do like this one and the philosophy\naspect.  This exact name has another domain squatter but I like the direction\nanyhow.\nThePragmaticCoder.com - Interesting but no.\nAbstractedLogic.com - Not sure what to think of this one, might be too far\nafield.\nMasteringCodeCraft.com - I like the mastery and craftsmanship concepts but\nthis feels like it's promising something, and again potentially arrogant?\nTheArtOfCode.dev - I do like this one, but still not quite working for me.\nInnovativeSyntax.com - Nope.\nCodeWanderer.io - Cute but no.\nThoughtfulProgramming.com - Not quote, but something relating to thoughts\nor musings about programming might have possibilities.\nCerebralCoding.com - Too high-brow.\nLanguageAgnosticCoder.com - Definitely not.  I've worked with many\nprogramming languages but I'm not agnostic about them.  On the contrary, I have\nstrong preferences.\nSeamlessProgramming.io - Nope.\nCodePioneers.net - Nope.\nTheCodingCompass.com - Nope.\nFluidLogic.dev - Nope.\nBeyondTheCode.io - Nope.\nTheCodingOdysey.com - While \"odyssey\" is a bit interesting, still no.\nTheBalancedProgrammer.com - Balance is a good thing too, but still no.\nCodeFinesse.net - Finesse is also a good concept, but I don't think so.\nTheExpressiveCoder.com - Sounds too much about me again and doesn't feel\nright either.\nUniversalSyntax.dev - Doesn't make sense to me.  I think using \"syntax\" in\nthe name would be hard to make work, to be honest.\nTranscendingCode.com - Nope.\nCodeWisdom.io - No, sounds too arrogant again.  I may have strong opinions\nabout programming but I don't know that I want to be declaring that my opinions\nqualify as \"wisdom\".\nTheEloquentCoder.com - Again, eloquence is a good concept, but this doesn't\nwork either.\nTheVersatileDeveloper.com - Versatility is another good concept, but again,\nit's not about me.\nIntuitiveProgramming.net - Intuitive is another good concept but this\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nThank you for the detailed feedback!

I decided to go with \"codereflections.com\".  I have\nsuccessfully registered that domain name.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nCongratulations on registering your domain name, codereflections.com! Now that\nyou have the domain, you can start building your programming blog. Here are\nsome steps to help you get started:\n\nChoose a hosting provider: Select a reliable web hosting provider that\noffers good performance, uptime, and customer support. Popular options include\nBluehost, SiteGround, and DreamHost, among others.\nSet up your hosting account: Once you've chosen a hosting provider, sign up\nfor an account and configure it according to your needs. Most hosting providers\noffer easy integration with domain registrars, so you can easily connect your\ndomain to your hosting account.\nInstall a Content Management System (CMS): A CMS makes it easy to manage\nand publish content on your blog without the need for extensive technical\nknowledge. WordPress is the most popular CMS, offering a wide range of themes,\nplugins, and customization options.\nChoose a theme: Select a theme for your blog that reflects your style and\nthe focus of your content. Many themes are available for free, while others may\nrequire a one-time or recurring fee. Make sure the theme is responsive and\nmobile-friendly.\nCustomize your blog: Customize your blog's appearance, layout, and\nfunctionality using the CMS's built-in tools or by installing plugins. You can\nalso add your logo, change colors, and configure menus and widgets to your\nliking.\nCreate essential pages: Some basic pages you should create include an About\npage, a Contact page, and a Privacy Policy or Terms of Use page. These pages\nprovide information about you, your blog, and how visitors can get in touch\nwith you.\nPlan your content: Develop a content strategy that outlines the topics\nyou'll cover, the types of content you'll create (e.g., tutorials, opinion\npieces, reviews), and a rough publishing schedule.\nWrite and publish your first blog post: Write an introductory post that\nwelcomes visitors to your blog and gives them an idea of what to expect from\nyour future content. Be sure to optimize your content for search engines by\nusing relevant keywords, adding meta descriptions, and using headings.\nPromote your blog: Share your posts on social media, engage with other\nbloggers in your niche, and participate in relevant online communities to\ndrive traffic to your blog.\nMonitor your blog's performance: Use tools like Google Analytics to track\nyour blog's traffic, user engagement, and other key performance indicators.\nThis data will help you make informed decisions about your content strategy\nand promotional efforts.\n\nRemember, building a successful blog takes time and consistent effort. Keep\ncreating valuable content for your readers, and over time, you will see your\nblog grow and attract a loyal audience. Good luck with your new programming\nblog!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nAre you able to help with graphic design to create a cool logo for the blog?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nAs an AI language model, I am unable to create visual content directly.\nHowever, I can help guide you through the process of designing a logo or\nprovide suggestions on what elements to include in your logo to make it unique\nand appealing.\nHere are some tips to consider when creating a logo for your blog:\n\nKeep it simple: A simple logo is often more memorable and easier to\nrecognize.  Stick to a few essential elements that represent your blog's theme\nor your programming interests.\nChoose the right colors: Colors can evoke emotions and create associations.\nChoose colors that complement your blog's theme and resonate with your target\naudience. For example, you might use blue to represent trust and\nprofessionalism, or green for growth and creativity.\nUse typography wisely: Choose a font that is legible and complements the\nother elements of your logo. You might consider using a programming-related\nfont, such as a monospace font, to reflect the nature of your blog.\nIncorporate relevant imagery: Consider including a symbol or icon that\nrepresents your blog's focus on programming, such as curly braces, a code\nsnippet, or a stylized representation of a computer or programming language.\nMake it scalable: Your logo should be easy to recognize and look good at\ndifferent sizes, whether it's displayed on a website, social media, or printed\nmaterials.\n\nIf you're not comfortable designing a logo yourself, you have a few options:\n\nHire a professional graphic designer: A professional designer will be able\nto create a high-quality, unique logo that meets your specifications. You can\nfind designers on freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or 99designs.\nUse a logo maker tool: Online logo makers like Canva, Looka, or Tailor\nBrands can help you create a logo using pre-made templates and elements. These\ntools are user-friendly and typically more affordable than hiring a designer.\nCollaborate with a design-savvy friend: If you have a friend or\nacquaintance with design skills, consider asking for their help in exchange for\na favor or a small fee.\n\nRegardless of the method you choose, make sure to take your time and iterate\non your design until you're satisfied with the result. A well-designed logo\ncan make a significant impact on your blog's branding and overall success.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nLooks like it was luck that \"codereflections.com\" was available.  From\nsearching archive.org, I found that someone used the domain once before for a\nblog in 2009 which had no new posts after September 2009.  It was still online\nin 2011; for years after that, HTTP 302 errors were coming back, and eventually\nit looks like a domain squatter had it as recently as a year or two ago, but\nI guess they gave up and let it expire.  Score!\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nThat's great to hear! It's always nice to find a domain name that suits your\nneeds and is available, especially when it has some history behind it. Now you\ncan give \"codereflections.com\" a new life with your programming blog. It's an\nexcellent opportunity to create fresh and engaging content for your audience.\nMake sure to take advantage of this and use it to create a successful and\ninformative blog. Good luck with your new blogging endeavor!\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis conversation was very long, and it took hours to get the HTML/CSS working\nto format this conversation nicely, so I'm not going to add any additional\ncommentary.  My next post will continue talking about the process of creating\nthis blog from scratch.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/","title":"What's in a name?"},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/20/how-the-sausage-is-made/":{"body":"Continuing the origin story of this blog, after a long conversation with\nChatGPT, I had settled on a name and was lucky enough to be able to register\nthe \"codereflections.com\" domain.  Next, I had to choose a blogging platform\nand hosting platform.  Should I use WordPress or something else?  I needed to\ndo some research and think about this decision.  ChatGPT was happy to help.\n\nThe need to choose a blogging platform was mentioned in ChatGPT's response to\nmy very first message in the conversation about starting this blog.  Here is\nthat initial exchange; it was immediately followed by the lengthy ChatGPT\nconversation quoted in yesterday's post about\nthe search for a name for the blog:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHelp me start a new programming blog.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nStarting a new programming blog can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are\nsome steps to help you set up and launch your blog successfully:\n\n\nChoose a niche and target audience:\nDetermine the focus of your blog, whether it's a specific programming language,\ntechnology, or concept. This will help you attract a more targeted audience and\nprovide valuable content.\n\n\nSelect a blogging platform:\nChoose a suitable platform to host your blog, such as WordPress, Blogger, or\nMedium. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages, so consider your\nneeds and technical expertise when making your choice.\n\n\nPick a domain name and hosting:\nSelect a domain name that reflects the theme of your blog and is easy to\nremember. Register the domain and sign up for a hosting service to make your\nblog accessible online.\n\n\nCustomize the design:\nChoose a theme or template that aligns with your content and appeals to your\ntarget audience. Customize the design by adding your logo, color scheme, and\nother branding elements.\n\n\nPlan your content:\nCreate a content plan that outlines the topics you'll cover, the frequency of\nyour posts, and the type of content you'll create (tutorials, articles,\nreviews, etc.). A well-structured content plan will help you maintain\nconsistency and keep your audience engaged.\n\n\nWrite high-quality content:\nStart writing informative, engaging, and well-researched articles. Use clear\nlanguage, include relevant code snippets, and provide practical examples to\nillustrate your points. Focus on providing value to your readers and\nestablishing yourself as an expert in your niche.\n\n\nPromote your blog:\nShare your posts on social media, join relevant forums, and participate in\nonline communities to increase your blog's visibility. You can also consider\nguest posting on other blogs or collaborating with fellow programmers to\nreach a\n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\nYes, the response was truncated in the middle of the sentence like that, but I\ndidn't ask ChatGPT to repeat it, so I don't know what the rest of the response\nwas meant to be.  I've found message truncation like this to be a fairly common\nproblem with the chat.openai.com ChatGPT platform.\nResponses from ChatGPT which exceed 2048 bytes in length are truncated.  It's\npossible to work around it, but this rather small length limit is definitely a\nnuisance.  (I'm using ChatGPT Plus; this conversation was using the GPT-4\nmodel.)\nNear the end of the conversation about names, ChatGPT mentioned the blogging\nplatform again:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOkay, enough about names.  I decided to go with \"codereflections.com\".  I have\nsuccessfully registered that domain name.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCongratulations on registering your domain name, codereflections.com! Now that\nyou have the domain, you can start building your programming blog. Here are\nsome steps to help you get started:\n[...]\n\nInstall a Content Management System (CMS): A CMS makes it easy to manage\nand publish content on your blog without the need for extensive technical\nknowledge. WordPress is the most popular CMS, offering a wide range of\nthemes, plugins, and customization options.\n\n[...]\n      \n    \n  \n\nI'm planning to try to monetize this blog in the usual ways, so I threw that\ninto the mix:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat's the best way of starting the blog while making it easy to monetize in\nthe future if I can find an audience?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo start your blog while keeping future monetization options open, follow these\nsteps:\n\n\nChoose a platform: Select a blogging platform that offers flexibility for\nmonetization. WordPress is highly recommended because it's highly customizable\nand offers a variety of plugins for monetization.\n\n\nInvest in hosting and a domain: Purchase a reliable hosting plan and a\ncustom domain name, like the one you've already registered. A custom domain\nwill make your blog appear more professional and easier to monetize.\n\n\nDesign your blog: Create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly blog\ndesign. Use a responsive theme to ensure that your site looks great on all\ndevices. If needed, invest in a premium theme or hire a designer to create a\ncustom design.\n\n\nCreate quality content: Focus on producing high-quality, engaging, and\ninformative content for your readers. This will help you attract an audience\nand keep them coming back for more.\n\n\nPromote your blog: Use social media, networking, guest posting, and other\nmarketing techniques to drive traffic to your blog. The more traffic you have,\nthe more attractive your blog will be to advertisers and potential monetization\npartners.\n\n\nBuild an email list: Start collecting email addresses from your visitors.\nAn email list can be an essential tool for promoting your content and\nmonetizing your blog.\n\n\nPlan for monetization: Research and plan for various monetization methods,\nsuch as affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, display ads, and selling digital\nproducts or services. As your audience grows, you can start implementing these\nmethods.\n\n\nTrack your progress: Use analytics tools like Google Analytics to track\nyour blog's performance. This will help you make data-driven decisions about\nyour content strategy and monetization efforts.\n\n\nEngage with your audience: Respond to comments and interact with your\nreaders on social media. Building a loyal and engaged audience will make it\neasier to monetize your blog in the future.\n\n\nBe patient and persistent: Building a successful blog takes time and\neffort. Be patient, keep learning, and stay consistent with your content and\npromotional efforts. As your audience grows, monetization opportunities will\nfollow.\n\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to creating a blog that is\nnot only engaging and informative but also has the potential for monetization\nin the future.\n      \n    \n  \n\nObviously, WordPress is the 800-pound gorilla in the room.  It's what everyone\nseems to recommend and what most people seem to use.  According to\nwordpress.com, \"42% of the web is built on\nWordPress.\"  I don't know how accurate that is, but there are probably tens of\nmillions of WordPress blogs out there.\nI'm sure there are a lot of good reasons to consider using WordPress, and maybe\nI'll have a compelling reason to use it in the future.  For now, I'm avoiding\nusing WordPress.  It's written in PHP, which is a language I really dislike.\nIt's also a dynamic website, so the performance could be slow.  Despite being\nable to theoretically use WordPress for free, it does appear to have a lot of\npotential costs associated with it.  I won't rule it out for the future, but I\ndidn't want to start with WordPress, so I steered the conversation away from\nthat option.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI don't want to use WordPress.  It's written in PHP and PHP sucks.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf you don't want to use WordPress, there are several other blogging platforms\nand content management systems (CMS) to choose from. Some popular alternatives\ninclude:\n\n\nGhost (https://ghost.org/): Ghost is a modern and open-source platform\ndesigned for bloggers and writers. It is built on Node.js and offers a clean\nand minimalistic user interface. It's easy to use and has built-in SEO\nfeatures.\n\n\nJekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/): Jekyll is a static site generator\nwritten in Ruby. It's ideal for developers who prefer a lightweight platform\nand want to use Markdown for writing content. You can host your Jekyll blog on\nGitHub Pages for free or on any web server that supports static files.\n\n\nHugo (https://gohugo.io/): Hugo is another static site generator, but\nit's written in Go. It's known for its speed and flexibility. You can host\nyour Hugo blog on various platforms, including Netlify, Vercel, or any web\nserver that supports static files.\n\n\nGatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): Gatsby is a React-based,\nopen-source framework for building websites and applications. It generates\nstatic files but can also work with dynamic content through APIs.  Gatsby\nintegrates well with various headless CMS options like Contentful, Strapi, or\nDatoCMS.\n\n\nNetlify CMS (https://www.netlifycms.org/): Netlify CMS is an\nopen-source content management system that works with static site generators\nlike Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. It provides an easy-to-use interface for\nmanaging your content and can be hosted on Netlify or other hosting providers\nthat support static files.\n\n\nWhen choosing an alternative to WordPress, consider the features, flexibility,\nand ease of use that each platform offers. Some platforms may require more\ntechnical knowledge than others, but they can provide a more customizable and\nlightweight solution for your blog.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre there any implemented in Rust?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there are some static site generators and blogging platforms implemented\nin Rust. Some popular options include:\n\n\nZola (https://www.getzola.org/): Zola is a fast static site generator\nwritten in Rust. It offers features such as shortcodes, themes, and Sass\ncompilation out of the box. It also supports various templating languages like\nTera and Markdown for content creation. Zola is a great option if you're\nlooking for a Rust-based alternative to Jekyll or Hugo.\n\n\nCobalt (https://cobalt-org.github.io/): Cobalt is another static site\ngenerator written in Rust. It supports Liquid templates and provides basic\nfeatures like tags, categories, and pagination. Cobalt is a lightweight option\nfor creating simple blogs or websites.\n\n\nGutenberg (https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg): Gutenberg is a static\nsite generator in Rust that offers features like live reloading and Sass\ncompilation. However, it is no longer actively maintained, and the project has\nbeen archived on GitHub. You might want to consider Zola instead, which is\nactively maintained and offers similar features.\n\n\nWhen using a Rust-based platform, keep in mind that you'll need to have Rust\ninstalled on your system to build and generate your site. Additionally, you can\nhost your generated static files on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or\nVercel.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nStatic site generator?  Will that make it somewhat limiting?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing a static site generator can have some limitations compared to a dynamic\ncontent management system like WordPress. However, for a programming blog, a\nstatic site generator is often more than enough to meet your needs. Some points\nto consider:\n\n\nPerformance: Static site generators create pre-rendered HTML files, which\nleads to faster load times and a better user experience. You don't need to\nworry about server-side rendering, as the files are served directly to the\nuser.\n\n\nSecurity: Since static sites don't rely on a database or server-side\nprocessing, they are less prone to security vulnerabilities like SQL injections\nand other attacks.\n\n\nMaintenance: Static site generators require less maintenance and updates\ncompared to dynamic CMS platforms. You don't need to worry about updating\nplugins, themes, or the platform itself.\n\n\nCost: Hosting static sites is often cheaper and easier because you don't\nneed a complex server infrastructure. You can use platforms like GitHub\nPages, Netlify, or Vercel, which offer free hosting for static sites.\n\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to consider:\n\n\nDynamic features: Implementing features like real-time comments, search, or\nuser accounts can be more challenging with static sites. However, you can still\nintegrate third-party services like Disqus for comments or Algolia for search\nfunctionality.\n\n\nContent updates: With static site generators, you need to rebuild and\nredeploy your site every time you make changes or add new content. This can be\na bit time-consuming, especially for larger sites. However, this is usually not\nan issue for personal blogs with occasional updates.\n\n\nLearning curve: If you're not familiar with the static site generator's\nsyntax, templating language, or build process, there may be a learning curve\ninvolved.  However, this can also be an opportunity to learn new technologies\nand improve your skills.\n\n\nIn conclusion, a static site generator may have some limitations, but for a\nprogramming blog, it can be an excellent choice. It offers simplicity,\nperformance, and security benefits that can outweigh the limitations,\nespecially if you're willing to work around them or use third-party services to\nenhance your site's functionality.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI wanted to explore the possibility of hosting the site on GitHub Pages for\nfree, so I explored that too:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nJekyll blogs can be hosted on GitHub Pages for free, is Jekyll the only option\nfor the free hosting?  If hosted that way, can it still be monetized?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nJekyll is not the only option for free hosting on GitHub Pages. You can use\nother static site generators as well, such as Hugo, Gatsby, 11ty, Hexo, or\nPelican, to name a few. The key is to generate the static HTML files that you\ncan then host on GitHub Pages.\nYes, you can still monetize a blog hosted on GitHub Pages. Monetization\noptions, such as running ads, promoting affiliate products, or offering\nsponsored content, are not tied to the hosting platform but rather to the\ncontent and structure of your site. Some common monetization methods for static\nsites include:\n\n\nAffiliate marketing: You can join affiliate programs and include affiliate\nlinks in your blog posts. When users click on these links and make a purchase,\nyou'll earn a commission.\n\n\nDisplay ads: You can sign up for an ad network like Google AdSense and\ndisplay ads on your site. You'll earn revenue based on the number of\nimpressions or clicks the ads receive.\n\n\nSponsored content: You can collaborate with companies or other content\ncreators to create sponsored blog posts, reviews, or tutorials.\n\n\nSell digital products or services: You can create and sell ebooks, online\ncourses, or offer consulting services related to your blog's niche.\n\n\nDonations or memberships: You can ask your audience for support through\ndonations using platforms like Patreon, Ko-fi, or by offering premium content\nor access to a members-only community.\n\n\nTo implement these monetization methods, you'll need to add the necessary HTML,\nJavaScript, or third-party integrations to your static site generator's\ntemplates or content files. This can usually be done with most static site\ngenerators, including those that can be hosted on GitHub Pages.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nGitHub doesn't have any terms of service prohibiting monetization of a blog\nhosted for free?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGitHub does not have specific terms of service prohibiting the monetization of\na blog hosted on GitHub Pages. According to their terms of service, GitHub\nPages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages.\nHowever, there are some guidelines you should follow to ensure that you comply\nwith their terms:\n\n\nGitHub Pages should not be used for commercial purposes, like running an\nonline store. Monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or sponsored content is\ngenerally acceptable, as long as the primary purpose of your blog is to provide\ncontent and not solely to generate revenue.\n\n\nGitHub Pages should not be used for hosting activities that violate the\nGitHub Acceptable Use Policies, such as distributing spam, hosting illegal\ncontent, or engaging in activities that interfere with the operation of\nGitHub's services.\n\n\nGitHub Pages sources must be stored in a public repository, so be mindful of\nthe content you store and the privacy of any sensitive information.\n\n\nDon't overuse resources. GitHub Pages is a free service, and excessive use\nof resources could potentially result in throttling or suspension of your site.\n\n\nIt's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with GitHub's Terms of Service\nand Acceptable Use Policies to ensure that you are in compliance. If you are\never unsure about whether your blog's monetization strategy complies with\nGitHub's terms, you can always reach out to their support team for\nclarification.\nRemember that if you ever feel limited by GitHub Pages or concerned about\ncompliance, there are other free or affordable hosting options available, like\nNetlify or Vercel, that can also host static sites generated with Jekyll or\nother static site generators.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nExcessive use of resources?  What if there were a lot of visitors to the site?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGitHub Pages is designed to handle a reasonable amount of traffic for personal,\norganization, or project pages. However, it is not intended to support\nextremely high levels of traffic, like those of a popular commercial website.\nIn practice, most personal blogs and projects hosted on GitHub Pages do not\nexperience any issues with traffic.\nIf your blog becomes very popular and starts to receive a large amount of\ntraffic, GitHub may throttle or limit the resources allocated to your site. In\nsuch a case, you might need to consider moving to a different hosting provider\nthat can better accommodate your needs.\nAlternatives like Netlify or Vercel are well-suited to handle higher levels of\ntraffic for static sites, and they offer free plans with generous resource\nallocations. Additionally, these platforms provide scalable paid plans to\naccommodate further growth.\nIt's essential to monitor your site's traffic and performance, and if you\nnotice any issues, consider upgrading to a more robust hosting solution that\ncan handle the increased demand.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSuppose I use one of the static site generators and host it on GitHub Pages.\nShould I have a separate GitHub account for the site?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's not strictly necessary to create a separate GitHub account for your blog\nhosted on GitHub Pages. You can host your blog using your existing GitHub\naccount, under a new repository. However, there are some potential benefits to\ncreating a separate account specifically for your blog:\n\n\nOrganization: Having a separate account for your blog can help keep your\npersonal projects and blog content separate and organized.\n\n\nPrivacy: Using a separate account allows you to maintain a certain level\nof privacy for your personal GitHub account. This can be especially helpful if\nyou don't want blog visitors to associate your blog with your personal or\nprofessional projects.\n\n\nCollaboration: If you plan on collaborating with others on your blog,\nhaving a dedicated account makes it easier to manage access and permissions for\nthe blog repository.\n\n\nUltimately, the decision to create a separate GitHub account for your blog\ndepends on your preferences and needs. If you're comfortable with using your\npersonal account and don't see any immediate benefits from creating a new one,\nyou can continue using your existing account.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIf I make a separate GitHub account, should it be an organization account?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCreating an organization account can be a good idea for your blog project,\nespecially if you plan to collaborate with others or manage multiple\nrepositories related to your blog. Here are some advantages of using an\norganization account:\n\n\nTeam management: Organizations in GitHub allow you to manage teams and\ntheir permissions easily. You can create different teams with specific\naccess levels and invite collaborators as needed.\n\n\nRepository management: An organization account can have multiple\nrepositories, which can be helpful if you have related projects for your\nblog, such as themes, plugins, or additional resources.\n\n\nCentralized billing: If you decide to upgrade to a paid plan for your\nblog or other related repositories, organization accounts provide\ncentralized billing for all associated repositories.\n\n\nProfessional appearance: An organization account can give your blog a\nmore professional appearance, as it separates your blog project from your\npersonal GitHub account.\n\n\nHowever, if you're just starting out and don't expect to collaborate with\nothers or manage multiple repositories, using a regular user account may be\nsufficient. You can always create an organization later if your needs change.\nKeep in mind that creating an organization account is free, but some advanced\nfeatures might require a paid plan.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nMultiple repositories might be useful.  I could have a repository online with\nthe code used in a particular blog post for example.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAbsolutely! Using multiple repositories can be an excellent way to organize and\nmanage the code samples and other resources related to your blog posts. By\ncreating separate repositories for each code example or project, you can:\n\n\nImprove organization: Keeping code samples separate from your blog's\nmain repository makes it easier for you and your readers to find and\nnavigate through the code.\n\n\nSimplify collaboration: If you're working with other contributors or\naccepting pull requests, having separate repositories for each code example\ncan make the collaboration process smoother.\n\n\nEnable version control: Using a repository for each code sample allows\nyou to take advantage of Git's version control features, such as branches,\ntags, and commit history, making it easier to manage updates and revisions.\n\n\nFacilitate code reuse: By hosting the code samples in separate\nrepositories, you make it easier for readers to clone, fork, or download the\ncode for their own use and experimentation.\n\n\nTo link the code repositories to your blog posts, you can include a reference\nor hyperlink within the post, directing readers to the corresponding GitHub\nrepository. This way, your readers can easily access, study, and experiment\nwith the code related to the content they're reading.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I went to GitHub to see if I could create an organizational\naccount and name it \"codereflections\" to match the domain name.  Unfortunately,\nsomeone registered it back in 2018, then apparently never used it.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUnfortunately, someone is already squatting on the GitHub username\n\"codereflections\" even though they haven't done anything with it.  The account\nwas created in November 2018 and has had ZERO account activity since then.  Is\nthere any chance GitHub could be convinced to delete that account so I can\ncreate that username, given that it's been reserved for years and never used?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's unlikely that GitHub would delete the inactive account just to free up the\nusername for you. GitHub's username squatting policy typically requires a\ntrademark owner to file a complaint for the release of a username, and even\nthen, it's not guaranteed.\nHowever, you can try contacting GitHub Support to see if they would be willing\nto help in this situation. While it might be a long shot, it's worth a try. You\ncan reach out to GitHub Support via their contact form:\nhttps://support.github.com/contact\nIf GitHub doesn't release the username, you can consider alternative options\nfor the account name. For example, you could use a variation of\n\"codereflections\", such as \"code_reflections\", \"codereflectionsblog\", or\n\"thecodereflections\". This way, you'll still have a name closely related to\nyour domain while working around the username issue.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt appears that the \"code_reflections\" username doesn't exist, so I guess\nthat's a good fallback option.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThat's great! You can go ahead and create a new GitHub account with the\n\"code_reflections\" username as your fallback option. This will still closely\nrelate to your domain name, and your audience should easily recognize it. Once\nyou set up your account, you can start working on your blog using a static site\ngenerator and host it on GitHub Pages. Remember to also set up a custom domain\nfor your GitHub Pages site, so it points to your \"codereflections.com\" domain.\nGood luck with your new blog!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWould GitHub give my request more consideration now that I've registered the\n\"codereflections.com\" domain name?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's possible that owning the \"codereflections.com\" domain name might give your\nrequest more credibility, but it's still up to GitHub's discretion whether they\ndecide to release the inactive account or not. You can try reaching out to\nGitHub support with your request, explaining your situation and providing proof\nthat you own the \"codereflections.com\" domain.\nHowever, keep in mind that there's no guarantee they will release the username,\nas they might have their own policies regarding account management. In case\nthey decide not to release the username, using \"code_reflections\" as a fallback\noption is still a good choice.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI tried opening a support ticket, but they just closed it without a reply, so I\ndecided to create the organization account as \"code-reflections\" instead.  Not\nideal, but oh well.  (I haven't started using that account yet.)\nAfter this, I asked ChatGPT to help with the initial blog post, as I described\nin that post.  Then I investigated\nthemes, since that might decide which blogging platform I wanted to use.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs there a good standard design layout I can use?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there are several standard design layouts that you can use as a starting\npoint for your blog. One popular and effective layout is the F-shaped pattern.\nThis layout takes into account the natural reading pattern of users, where they\ntend to read content in an F-shaped pattern, scanning horizontally across the\ntop, then down the left side and across the middle.\nHere's a basic structure for an F-shaped layout:\n\n\nHeader: Include your blog's logo, navigation menu, and potentially a search\nbar.\n\n\nMain Content Area: This is where your blog posts will appear. Use a clear\nand easy-to-read font with appropriate line spacing. You can choose to display\nyour posts in a single column or a grid format.\n\n\nSidebar: Place the sidebar on the right side of the main content area. Include\nelements such as a brief author bio, a list of recent or popular posts, social\nmedia links, and potentially an email subscription form.\n\n\nFooter: Use this area to display additional navigation links, a copyright\nnotice, and any other relevant information or disclaimers.\n\n\nMake sure to use whitespace effectively to separate different sections and\navoid clutter. You can also incorporate responsive design principles to ensure\nthat your blog looks good on various devices and screen sizes.\nMany static site generators, including Jekyll, come with built-in themes that\nfollow standard design layouts. You can start with one of these themes and then\ncustomize it to match your preferences and branding.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhich static site generators come with the best default themes?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSeveral static site generators come with impressive default themes, providing\nyou with a solid starting point for your blog. Here are a few popular options:\n\n\nJekyll: Jekyll is one of the most popular static site generators and offers\na variety of default themes that are clean, responsive, and easy to customize.\nJekyll's most popular default theme is \"Minima,\" which provides a minimalistic\ndesign and focuses on readability. Jekyll also has a large community, so you\ncan find many other high-quality, free themes created by users.\n\n\nHugo: Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator with a collection of\nbuilt-in themes. Its default theme, \"Ananke,\" is modern and clean, with a\nresponsive design. There are also numerous other themes available in the Hugo\nThemes Showcase that you can use as a starting point for your blog.\n\n\nGatsby: Gatsby is a powerful and flexible static site generator based on\nReact.  While Gatsby doesn't have a default theme per se, it has a rich\necosystem of starter templates, which include themes and pre-configured setups\nto help you get started quickly. Gatsby Starter Blog is a popular choice for\nbloggers, offering a clean and responsive design.\n\n\nEleventy (11ty): Eleventy is a simpler static site generator, offering a\ngreat degree of flexibility. Although it doesn't come with a built-in theme,\nthere are several starter projects available, like \"eleventy-base-blog,\" which\nprovides a clean, responsive, and easy-to-customize design for your blog.\n\n\nEach of these static site generators has its advantages, and the best choice\nwill depend on your specific needs and preferences. Keep in mind that all of\nthese options have active communities, which means you can find additional\nthemes and resources to help you create a blog that meets your requirements.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nLet's suppose that I'll use Jekyll.  What would be the best theme to use that\nwould incorporate Google AdSense and Outbrain well?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen choosing a Jekyll theme that incorporates Google AdSense and Outbrain, you\nshould look for a theme that is clean, responsive, and has dedicated ad spaces\nor is easy to customize for ad placements. While many themes can be customized\nto incorporate ad networks, here are a few themes that are well-suited for\nintegrating Google AdSense and Outbrain:\n\nChirpy: Chirpy is a minimal, responsive, and SEO-friendly Jekyll theme.

When customizing these themes, edit the appropriate template files\n(such as `_includes` or `_layouts`) and insert the ad code where\nyou want the ads to appear.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI also wanted comment support, and I wasn't sure how to do that with a static\nsite generator, so I asked about that too.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat is the best way to integrate comment support?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere are several ways to integrate comment support for your Jekyll blog. Since\nJekyll generates static pages, you'll need to rely on third-party services to\nhandle comments. Here are some popular options:\n\nDisqus: Disqus is a widely-used commenting platform that's easy to integrate\nwith Jekyll. To add Disqus to your Jekyll blog, sign up for a Disqus account,\nand follow their instructions to obtain the universal embed code.

Always make sure to research the latest information and updates\nabout the chosen solution to ensure compatibility and support.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThat's enough for now; tomorrow I'll describe the search for a good hosting\nprovider to run a virtual Linux server of my own, since it appears to be needed\nfor a commenting solution, even if I'm hosting a static site on GitHub Pages...\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/20/how-the-sausage-is-made/","title":"How the sausage is made."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/":{"body":"Yesterday's post didn't finish the\nstory of selecting a blogging platform, because I diverted to a side quest of\nfinding a VPS hosting provider to be able to implement a comment system.  I'll\nfinish the story of the blogging platform in tomorrow's\npost.\n\nI was leaning towards using a static site generator at this point, but I still\nwanted to have a comment system and perhaps other dynamic features, so I\ndecided to look for a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting provider.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf I need a server to self-host these systems, is there any free option\navailable, or will I need to pay a monthly fee for one?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere are some free options available for hosting your self-hosted commenting\nsystem, but they often come with limitations. Here are a few free hosting\nproviders:\n\n\nHeroku (www.heroku.com): Heroku offers a free\ntier, but it comes with limitations, such as limited usage hours and the app\ngoing to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. It might not be ideal for a\nproduction environment, but it's suitable for testing and small projects.\n\n\nGlitch (www.glitch.com): Glitch is another\nplatform where you can host small projects and prototypes for free. It also\nhas limitations on usage and resources, and your app may go to sleep after a\nperiod of inactivity.\n\n\nOracle Cloud (www.oracle.com/cloud/free):\nOracle Cloud offers a free tier with limited resources. You can host small\nprojects on their \"Always Free\" tier, which includes compute and storage\nresources.\n\n\nThese options can work for hosting a self-hosted commenting system, but be\naware of their limitations. As your blog grows and traffic increases, you may\nneed to upgrade to a paid plan or switch to another hosting provider to ensure\nbetter performance, stability, and support.\nRemember that the options mentioned above are subject to change, and it's\nalways a good idea to research the latest offerings and terms of service for\neach provider.\n      \n    \n  \n\nFree options are great, but I wanted more flexibility and fewer limitations, so\nI wanted to explore the paid options as well.  However, I didn't want to drive\nup the cost of this project unnecessarily, just on general principle.  Rather\nthan just choosing one of the most obvious options (such as AWS), I wanted to\nlook for the most affordable reasonable option I could find.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat would be the most cost-efficient paid plans?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCost-efficient paid plans can vary based on your specific requirements, such as\nstorage, bandwidth, and server resources. Here are a few popular and\ncost-efficient hosting providers with their respective entry-level plans:\n\n\nDigitalOcean (www.digitalocean.com):\nDigitalOcean's most affordable plan starts at $5/month, offering 1GB of RAM,\n1 vCPU, 25GB SSD storage, and 1TB of data transfer. They provide scalable\nvirtual private servers (VPS) and a user-friendly control panel.\n\n\nLinode (www.linode.com): Linode's entry-level\nplan starts at $5/month, with 1GB of RAM, 1 vCPU, 25GB SSD storage, and 1TB\nof data transfer. They provide scalable VPS solutions and a simple-to-use\ncontrol panel.\n\n\nVultr (www.vultr.com): Vultr's most affordable\nplan starts at $3.50/month, offering 1GB of RAM, 1 vCPU, 25GB SSD storage,\nand 1TB of data transfer. They offer scalable VPS solutions with an easy-to-use\ninterface.\n\n\nAWS Lightsail\n(aws.amazon.com/lightsail): Amazon\nWeb Services (AWS) Lightsail's most affordable plan starts at $3.50/month,\nproviding 512MB of RAM, 1 vCPU, 20GB SSD storage, and 1TB of data transfer.\nIt's a simplified version of AWS's extensive cloud services.\n\n\nHetzner Cloud (www.hetzner.com/cloud):\nHetzner's entry-level plan starts at €2.49/month (approximately\n$2.75/month), offering 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB SSD storage, and 20TB of data\ntransfer. They provide scalable VPS solutions with competitive pricing.\n\n\nThese are just a few examples of cost-efficient hosting providers. Keep in mind\nthat each provider's features, performance, and customer support can vary. It's\nessential to research and choose the provider that best fits your needs and\nbudget. Be sure to check for any additional costs, such as backup services,\nadditional IP addresses, or data transfer overages.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI was concerned about the possibility of a DDoS attack causing excessive\ntraffic, exceeding bandwidth limits, and causing unlimited additional costs for\nbandwidth overages.  As such, I preferred to find a flat-rate option which\nwouldn't have a risk of bandwidth overage charges.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAre there any which offer unlimited bandwidth for a flat rate?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's difficult to find hosting providers that offer truly unlimited bandwidth\nfor a flat rate. Most providers have fair usage policies or restrictions in\nplace to prevent abuse of resources. However, some hosting providers market\ntheir plans as offering \"unlimited\" bandwidth, although there might still be\nlimitations or restrictions in place. Here are a couple of options you can\nconsider:\n\n\nDreamHost (www.dreamhost.com): DreamHost\noffers shared hosting plans with unlimited bandwidth, starting at\n$2.59/month.  However, shared hosting might not be suitable for self-hosting a\ncommenting system, as the performance may not be as good as a VPS.\nAdditionally, their VPS plans, which start at $10/month, come with unlimited\nbandwidth as well, but they do have a fair usage policy in place.\n\n\nHostinger (www.hostinger.com): Hostinger\noffers shared hosting plans with unlimited bandwidth, starting at\n$1.39/month.  Like DreamHost, shared hosting might not be the best option for\nself-hosting a commenting system. Hostinger's VPS plans start at $3.95/month\nand come with a specific amount of bandwidth, not unlimited.\n\n\nIt's essential to read the provider's terms of service and fair usage policies\nto understand the limitations and restrictions that may apply to \"unlimited\"\nbandwidth. Generally, VPS or cloud hosting providers offer specific data\ntransfer limits based on the plan you choose. If you expect high traffic on\nyour blog, it's better to choose a plan with a higher data transfer limit or\nconsider providers with scalable pricing based on actual usage.\n      \n    \n  \n\nShared hosting plans didn't sound like a great option.  These might offer\n\"unlimited\" bandwidth, but the limitations didn't sound appealing, so I tried\nexplaining more clearly what my goal was.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhich plans have flat rate charges with no extra billing for usage overages,\neven if that means throttling?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhile it's difficult to find hosting providers that guarantee no overage\ncharges with throttling instead, some providers are more lenient with their\npolicies. Here are two providers that are known for their generous resource\nallocations and flat-rate pricing:\n\n\nDreamHost (www.dreamhost.com): DreamHost's\nVPS plans, which start at $10/month, come with unlimited bandwidth, but they\ndo have a fair usage policy in place. While they don't explicitly mention\nthrottling, their policy focuses on preventing abuse of resources. In general,\nDreamHost has a reputation for being lenient with their usage policies, making\nit a good choice for flat-rate pricing.\n\n\nA2 Hosting (www.a2hosting.com): A2 Hosting\noffers VPS plans starting at $5/month, which include unmetered bandwidth.\nThey don't explicitly mention throttling, but their policy is centered around\npreventing abuse and ensuring fair usage of resources. A2 Hosting is known for\nits customer-friendly approach and resource allocations.\n\n\nIt's important to note that the terms and policies may change, and every\nprovider handles usage differently. Always read the provider's terms of service\nand fair usage policies to understand the limitations and restrictions that may\napply. Reach out to their customer support if you need clarification on their\npolicies or have specific requirements.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWhen I looked at the DreamHost website, I saw another option for their\nWordPress hosting plan.  Even though I didn't intend to go with WordPress, I\ndecided to ask ChatGPT for an opinion anyhow.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHmm, DreamHost has a WordPress hosting plan.  Should I be considering that?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDreamHost's WordPress hosting plan can be a good option if you decide to use\nWordPress for your blog. They offer managed WordPress hosting plans that are\noptimized for performance and security. Some benefits of using DreamHost's\nWordPress hosting include:\n\n\nEasy installation: DreamHost makes it easy to install and set up WordPress\nwith their one-click installer.\n\n\nAutomatic updates: DreamHost automatically updates the WordPress core and\nplugins, ensuring that your website is always up to date and secure.\n\n\nEnhanced security: Their managed WordPress hosting includes built-in\nserver-level security measures to protect your site from hacks and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\nFree SSL certificate: DreamHost provides a free SSL certificate to ensure\nthat your site is secure and compliant with modern web standards.\n\n\nDaily backups: DreamHost automatically backs up your site daily, making it\neasy to restore your site in case of data loss or other issues.\n\n\n24/7 support: DreamHost offers round-the-clock support via email and live\nchat to help you with any issues that may arise.\n\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that you don't want to use WordPress due to its\nuse of PHP, you might prefer to stick with a static site generator like Jekyll\nand host it on GitHub Pages or another hosting provider. If you change your\nmind about WordPress, DreamHost's WordPress hosting is a reliable option to\nconsider.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOf course, I wasn't relying on ChatGPT alone here.  During this conversation, I\nwas also using Google and DuckDuckGo to search for good options too.  One of\nthe pages I found was a TechRadar article titled\n\"Unlimited vs. metered vs. unmetered bandwidth hosting\".\nAfter reading this article, I realized that I should be searching for\n\"unmetered\" bandwidth rather than \"unlimited\" bandwidth as the better option.\nWhen I started searching for unmetered options, I found this LowEndBox blog\npost titled \"A 2GB VPS with Unmetered Bandwidth for $1 a\nMonth?!?!?\".\nThis post talked about a cheap VPS with 2GB RAM, KVM, 20GB SSD SATA, unmetered\n100Mbps traffic and DDoS protection for $0.97/month.  Of course, this was only\nan introductory price; after the first 12 months, it would cost $4.20/month,\nwhich still sounded like a decent option.\nI wasn't familiar with this LowEndBox website, but\nthis is their description of the site:\n\nLowEndBox is dedicated to helping people run websites and services on low end\ndedicated servers and cheap virtual private servers, where you only need to\npay a few dollars a month. Our mission is to help people find cheap vps\nhosting.\n\nThis certainly sounds like a good resource to keep in mind for anyone looking\nfor a cheap VPS!\nI also found another great website to help with the search for a good but cheap\nVPS for this project, Server Hunter, which\nlets you search through a huge list of server offers while filtering the offers\nevery way you could imagine: product type (dedicated/hybrid/VPS), pricing,\nprovider, processor, memory, storage, network, software, virtualization type,\nlocation and other features.  This was an excellent resource.\nI searched on Server Hunter for VPS offers with a dedicated IPv4 address and\nunmetered bandwidth, and started researching each one starting with the\ncheapest offer, asking ChatGPT about some of them.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat can you tell me about hostthebest.com?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAs of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I am not familiar with\n\"hostthebest.com\" as a web hosting provider. It is possible that the provider\nhas emerged after that date or it is a less popular provider. When considering\na web hosting provider, it's important to research their reputation, customer\nreviews, pricing plans, performance, and customer support to ensure that they\nwill meet your needs.\nFor well-established and reputable web hosting providers, you can consider\ncompanies like DreamHost, SiteGround, Bluehost, or A2 Hosting, among others.\nThese providers have a proven track record of reliable service, performance,\nand customer support.\n      \n    \n  \n\nChatGPT is not familiar with this provider?  Hmm.  I tried searching the site\non the archive.org Wayback Machine and found 20 years of snapshots, so why\ndoesn't ChatGPT recognize them?  Curious.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \narchive.org shows snapshots of hostthebest.com going back 20 years.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion in my previous response. HostTheBest.com seems to\nbe an established web hosting provider that has been around for quite some\ntime. However, it may not be as popular or widely known as some of the other\nhosting providers I mentioned earlier.\nWhen evaluating HostTheBest.com, it is essential to research their reputation,\ncustomer reviews, pricing plans, performance, and customer support.\nAdditionally, compare their offerings with other hosting providers to make sure\nyou choose the one that best meets your needs.\nYou may also want to consider reaching out to their support team or sales\ndepartment to ask specific questions about their services and gather more\ninformation about the company.\n      \n    \n  \n\nChatGPT seems to apologize a lot sometimes!  At any rate, I continued my\nresearch.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow about \"typical.host\"?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\"Typical.host\" does not appear to be a well-known or popular web hosting\nprovider. A search for the company does not yield any significant results or\ninformation about their reputation, customer reviews, pricing plans, or\nperformance.\nIt is important to choose a reliable and reputable hosting provider to ensure\nthe security, performance, and stability of your website. I recommend\nconsidering the more established and popular hosting providers I previously\nmentioned, such as DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, or DreamHost, among others.\nThese providers have proven track records and are known for their customer\nsupport and reliable services.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHmm, another unpopular choice.  ChatGPT sure does seem eager to steer me back\nto its preferred suggestions!  Does it get kickbacks?!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nskysilk.com?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSkySilk Cloud Services (skysilk.com) is a cloud hosting provider that offers\nVPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting solutions. They have been around for a few\nyears and provide various plans to cater to different needs, including\ndeveloper, small business, and enterprise solutions.\nSkySilk's plans offer a range of resources such as RAM, storage, and CPU cores,\ndepending on your requirements. They also provide features like free DDoS\nprotection, SSD storage, and an easy-to-use management dashboard.\nAlthough SkySilk is not as widely known as some other hosting providers like\nDigitalOcean, Linode, or Vultr, they have received some positive reviews for\ntheir performance and customer support. It could be a viable option for hosting\nyour self-hosted comment system, but it's essential to research their offerings\nand customer feedback to ensure they meet your requirements and expectations.\n      \n    \n  \n\nFrom the searching I did, SkySilk does seem like a reputable provider, but\ntheir prices seem to have increased substantially from what they were said to\nbe offering a few years ago.  Scratch that one, I guess.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \ncloudfanatic.net?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI couldn't find any information about a hosting provider called\n\"cloudfanatic.net.\" It seems like the domain is not associated with a\nwell-known or established web hosting company. I would recommend considering\nreputable hosting providers with proven track records and positive customer\nreviews to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of your hosting\nsolution. Some popular options include DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, AWS, Google\nCloud Platform, and many others, depending on your requirements and\npreferences.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHere we go again.  Yes, I got the message about what the popular options are,\nI'm looking to see if I can find a better option than the popular ones!  This\nparticular one seems to have changed their name.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nLooks like they used to be called \"Servercheap Inc\"\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nServercheap Inc, now known as Cloudfanatic.net, appears to be a smaller web\nhosting provider. While smaller providers can offer competitive pricing and\nmore personalized support, it's essential to thoroughly research their\nperformance, reliability, and customer service before committing.\nWhen evaluating a hosting provider, consider factors such as uptime guarantees,\ncustomer reviews, available features, and the quality of their support team.\nIt's also a good idea to compare their offerings with those of more established\nproviders to ensure you're making an informed decision.\n      \n    \n  \n\nApparently another nobody, moving on...\nAs an aside, I asked about the \"LXC\" logo I had seen listed on many of the\nplans that SkySilk offered.  That didn't ring a bell offhand.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSkySilk plans show an \"LXC\" logo on many plans, what does that mean?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nLXC stands for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtualization technology that\nallows multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) to run on a single host.\nLXC containers share the same kernel as the host system, which makes them more\nresource-efficient and faster than traditional virtual machines (VMs) that\nrequire a separate kernel for each instance.\nWhen a hosting plan shows an \"LXC\" logo, it means that the provider is using\nLinux Containers for virtualization. This can offer better performance and\nresource management for your hosted applications and services, as LXC\ncontainers have lower overhead compared to traditional VMs. However, keep in\nmind that LXC containers are less isolated from the host system, which could\npotentially result in a slightly lower security level compared to full\nvirtualization.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOh, right.  I understand about Linux containers, having used Docker containers\nbefore.  I was pretty sure an LXC container would have root access, but it\nwouldn't hurt to confirm it.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWould the LXC container have root access?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, LXC containers typically provide root access to the container's\nenvironment. This allows you to have full control over the software and\nconfiguration within the container, as if it were a standalone system. However,\nthis root access is limited to the container itself and does not grant you root\naccess to the host system or other containers running on the same host.\nIt's essential to be cautious when using root access, as it allows you to\nperform actions that could potentially harm the container or its data. Always\nmake sure to understand the implications of the commands you run as root and\nfollow best practices for system administration and security.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThen it occurred to me...  I want to be able to run Docker containers on my\nserver!  I doubted that would be possible here.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs it possible to run Docker containers within?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nRunning Docker containers inside LXC containers is generally not recommended,\nas it can lead to compatibility issues and potential security risks. Both LXC\nand Docker use similar underlying technologies (like cgroups and namespaces),\nand nesting these containerization methods can create conflicts.\nIn some cases, it might be technically possible to run Docker inside an LXC\ncontainer, but it would require significant configuration adjustments and\npotentially decrease the isolation and security benefits of using containers in\nthe first place.\nIf you need to use both LXC and Docker containers, it's better to run them\nseparately on the same host or use a container orchestration platform like\nKubernetes to manage them. This approach allows you to maintain proper\nisolation and take advantage of the respective benefits of each\ncontainerization method.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, LXC container plans are out.  Meanwhile, I'm also checking into ChatGPT's\nfavored options too.  When I checked the linode.com\nwebsite, I discovered that Linode was acquired by Akamai in early 2022.  Since\nthat option appeared to be confusing and in flux, I decided to skip it.  How\nabout DigitalOcean?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt appears Linode was acquired by Akamai.  Tell me more about DigitalOcean.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDigitalOcean is a popular cloud infrastructure provider founded in 2011 by Ben\nUretsky, Moisey Uretsky, Mitch Wainer, Alec Hartman, and Jeff Carr. The company\nfocuses on providing simple, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions for\ndevelopers, startups, and small-to-medium-sized businesses.\nDigitalOcean's primary offerings include:\n\n\nDroplets: These are scalable virtual private servers (VPS) that can be\nquickly deployed and customized to match various computing needs. Droplets\ncan be created with different configurations of CPU, RAM, and storage to suit\nspecific use cases and performance requirements.\n\n\nKubernetes: DigitalOcean offers a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies\ncontainer orchestration and deployment. This service helps developers manage\nand scale containerized applications easily.\n\n\nApp Platform: A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that simplifies\napplication deployment, management, and scaling. It supports several popular\nprogramming languages and frameworks, including Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby,\nand more.\n\n\nBlock Storage: Scalable, high-performance SSD-based storage that can be\nattached to Droplets to expand storage capacity.\n\n\nObject Storage: DigitalOcean Spaces is an S3-compatible object storage\nservice, suitable for storing and serving large amounts of unstructured data\nlike images, videos, and backups.\n\n\nDatabases: Managed databases for popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL,\nand Redis, which can be quickly deployed and scaled as needed.\n\n\nNetworking: Various networking solutions, including Virtual Private Cloud\n(VPC), floating IPs, load balancers, and Cloud Firewalls, to enhance\nconnectivity and security.\n\n\nMarketplace: A collection of pre-configured applications and development\nstacks that can be quickly deployed on DigitalOcean infrastructure.\n\n\nDigitalOcean is known for its simplicity, user-friendly interface, extensive\ndocumentation, and active community. The company offers a pay-as-you-go pricing\nmodel, with competitive rates compared to other cloud providers. DigitalOcean\nhas data centers across the globe, ensuring low-latency access and redundancy\nfor its customers.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, sounds like a decent provider indeed.  But what about the bandwidth?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDoes DigitalOcean have unmetered plans?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDigitalOcean does not offer unmetered plans. They charge for bandwidth usage on\na pay-as-you-go basis, meaning you'll be billed for the data transfer used by\nyour Droplets (virtual private servers) and other services. However, their\npricing model is competitive, and they offer a generous amount of free\nbandwidth with each Droplet.\nFor example, at the time of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the most\nbasic Droplet plan included 1 TB of free outbound data transfer per month. If\nyour usage exceeds the free transfer limit, you will be charged for additional\ndata transfer at a specific rate per gigabyte (which may vary by region).\nIt's important to note that inbound data transfer to your Droplets is free and\ndoes not count towards your bandwidth usage. Also, data transfer between\nDroplets within the same data center is free and not counted towards the limit.\nYou can monitor your bandwidth usage through the DigitalOcean control panel,\nand it's a good idea to keep an eye on it to avoid unexpected costs if your\nusage increases beyond the included free transfer amount.\n      \n    \n  \n\nPay-as-you-go bandwidth?  No thanks.  That's what I'm trying to avoid!\nOkay, time to try a different approach...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat are the best cheap plans from reputable hosting providers with unmetered\nbandwidth?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFinding the perfect balance between price, reputation, and unmetered bandwidth\ncan be challenging. Here are some hosting providers that offer relatively\ninexpensive plans with unmetered bandwidth. Keep in mind that the specifics of\nthese plans may change over time, so it's always a good idea to check the\nprovider's website for the most up-to-date information:\n\nA2 Hosting: They offer shared hosting plans with unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"Lite\" plan is their most affordable option, which includes a\nsingle website, free SSL, and cPanel control panel.\nHostGator: Their shared hosting plans come with unmetered\nbandwidth. The \"Hatchling\" plan is their cheapest option, allowing for a single\ndomain, free SSL certificate, and a user-friendly control panel.\nDreamHost:  DreamHost provides shared hosting plans with unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"Shared Starter\" plan allows you to host one website with a\nfree domain, SSL certificate, and the use of their custom control panel.\nBluehost: Bluehost's shared hosting plans also include unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"Basic\" plan is the most affordable and supports one website,\na free domain, free SSL, and a user-friendly control panel.\nSiteGround: SiteGround offers shared hosting plans with unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"StartUp\" plan allows you to host one website, with a free\nSSL, daily backups, and a custom control panel.\n\nRemember that \"unmetered\" bandwidth does not necessarily mean \"unlimited.\"\nProviders may impose certain restrictions or fair usage policies to ensure that\ntheir services are not abused. It's essential to review the terms and\nconditions before choosing a hosting provider to ensure you understand the\nlimitations and guidelines.\n      \n    \n  \n\nShared hosting plans again?  That doesn't sound Docker-friendly!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDo any of these offer a dedicated VPS with root access that can run Docker\ncontainers on it?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, several of the mentioned hosting providers offer VPS hosting with root\naccess, allowing you to run Docker containers. Here are some details about the\nVPS offerings of these providers:\n\nA2 Hosting: They offer VPS hosting plans that come with root access\nand the ability to install Docker. Their unmanaged VPS plans are the most\naffordable option for developers comfortable with managing their server.\nHostGator: HostGator provides VPS hosting with full root access.\nTheir \"Snappy 2000\" plan is the entry-level VPS plan that allows you to install\nDocker and manage the server as needed.\nDreamHost: DreamHost offers VPS hosting plans with root access,\nallowing you to run Docker containers. Their \"Basic VPS\" plan provides a\nmanaged environment, while the \"Unmanaged VPS\" option is more suitable for\ndevelopers who prefer complete control over the server.\nBluehost: Bluehost's VPS hosting plans also include root access.\nTheir \"Standard\" plan is the most affordable option, providing you with the\nability to install Docker and manage your server.\nSiteGround: SiteGround no longer offers traditional VPS hosting\nplans. They have shifted their focus to cloud hosting, which also provides root\naccess and the ability to run Docker containers. However, their cloud hosting\nplans are generally more expensive than their shared hosting plans.\n\nAll of these providers have different plan options, pricing, and features. It's\nessential to review their offerings and determine which provider and plan best\nsuit your needs and budget.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSince Server Hunter can search by virtualization type, I decided to narrow the\nsearch based on which types could run Docker containers.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhich of these virtualization types would allow the virtual server to run\nDocker containers without difficulty? Hyper-V KVM LXC\nOpenVZ Other Xen VMware\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe virtualization types that allow you to run Docker containers without\ndifficulty are:\n\n\nKVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine): KVM is a full virtualization solution\nthat provides each virtual server with dedicated resources and complete\nisolation from other virtual machines. It allows you to run Docker containers\nwithout any issues.\n\n\nXen: Xen is another full virtualization solution that provides dedicated\nresources and isolation for virtual machines. You can run Docker containers\non Xen-based virtual servers without any problems.\n\n\nVMware: VMware is a popular virtualization platform that also allows you to\nrun Docker containers without any issues. It provides full virtualization\nand resource isolation for virtual machines.\n\n\nHyper-V: Hyper-V is a virtualization technology developed by Microsoft. It\nis a full virtualization solution that enables you to run Docker containers\nwithout any difficulties.\n\n\nLXC and OpenVZ are container-based virtualization technologies, which means\nthey share the host kernel and might have limitations when it comes to running\nDocker containers. While it is technically possible to run Docker within LXC or\nOpenVZ, it's generally not recommended due to potential compatibility and\nsecurity concerns.\nFor the best experience when running Docker containers, it is recommended to\nuse a full virtualization solution like KVM, Xen, VMware, or Hyper-V.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, it occurred to me to ask about the Server Hunter website,\nalthough it did seem legit to me.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow reputable is serverhunter.com?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nServerHunter.com is a web hosting comparison platform that helps users find and\ncompare various hosting providers and their plans. It gathers information from\nnumerous hosting providers and presents it in a user-friendly way, making it\neasier for users to make informed decisions when choosing a hosting service.\nWhile ServerHunter.com does provide a valuable service, it's essential to keep\nin mind that it is a comparison platform and not a hosting provider itself. It\nis always a good idea to research individual hosting providers and read reviews\nfrom trusted sources before making a final decision.\nAs a comparison platform, ServerHunter.com seems to have a positive reputation\nand has been mentioned in several online articles and forums related to web\nhosting. However, it's still essential to do your own research and use multiple\nsources when evaluating hosting providers and their plans.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre there similar server comparison sites?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there are several other server comparison sites that can help you find the\nbest hosting provider and plan for your needs. Some of these include:\n\n\nWebHostingGeeks.com: Web Hosting Geeks is a\nweb hosting review and comparison site that offers information on various\nhosting providers, their plans, and features. It also includes user reviews to\nhelp you make an informed decision.\n\n\nHostingAdvice.com: HostingAdvice.com provides\ncomprehensive reviews, comparisons, and guides for a wide range of hosting\nproviders and services. The site covers shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated\nservers, and more.\n\n\nHostAdvice.com: HostAdvice.com is another web\nhosting comparison site that offers detailed reviews, comparisons, and\nguides on hosting providers and their plans. It also features user reviews to\nhelp you make an informed decision.\n\n\nWebHostingTalk.com: WebHostingTalk is a\npopular online forum where users can discuss and share information about web\nhosting services, providers, and related topics. While not a direct comparison\nsite, it can be a valuable resource for finding information and opinions on\nvarious hosting providers and plans.\n\n\nWhoIsHostingThis.com: WhoIsHostingThis.com\nis a web hosting comparison site that offers detailed reviews and\ncomparisons of various hosting providers and plans. It also includes\nuser-generated reviews and a tool to help you determine which hosting provider\nis hosting a specific website.\n\n\nThese are just a few examples of server comparison sites available online.\nRemember to do thorough research and read multiple reviews before choosing a\nhosting provider and plan.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I found an offer from BuyVM that looked really good, so I asked\nChatGPT about this hosting provider.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat do you know about BuyVM/frantech.ca?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBuyVM, a part of the FranTech Solutions group, is a web hosting provider known\nfor its affordable and reliable hosting services. They offer a range of hosting\nsolutions, including Virtual Private Servers (VPS), dedicated servers, and\nshared hosting. Here are some key points about BuyVM and FranTech Solutions:\n\n\nFounded in 2010: FranTech Solutions, the parent company of BuyVM, has been\nin the hosting industry for over a decade, which indicates a level of\nstability and experience in the market.\n\n\nAffordable hosting options: BuyVM is known for its budget-friendly VPS\nhosting plans, which cater to different needs and requirements. They offer\nvarious packages with different resource allocations, making it easy for\ncustomers to choose a plan that suits their specific needs.\n\n\nKVM virtualization: BuyVM uses KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)\nvirtualization technology for its VPS hosting. KVM provides better isolation\nand performance compared to some other virtualization technologies, allowing\nfor a more stable hosting environment.\n\n\nSLA-backed uptime: BuyVM offers a 99.9% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA)\nfor their hosting services, ensuring that customers can expect reliable\nservice and minimal downtime.\n\n\nData center locations: BuyVM has multiple data center locations in the\nUnited States and Europe, allowing customers to choose a location that best\nsuits their target audience for better performance and latency.\n\n\nCustom control panel: BuyVM offers a custom-built control panel called\nStallion, which provides users with an easy-to-use interface to manage their\nhosting services.\n\n\nCustomer support: BuyVM provides customer support through email and a ticket\nsystem. While they do not offer live chat or phone support, they have a\nreputation for providing timely and helpful responses to customer inquiries.\n\n\nOverall, BuyVM is a reputable hosting provider known for its affordable VPS\nhosting plans and reliable service. As with any hosting provider, it's\nessential to research and read user reviews to get a better understanding of\ntheir service quality and customer support.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWe have a winner!  Affordable prices on good plans with full KVM virtualization\nfrom a well-established, reputable provider?  Great!  The SLA, data center\noptions and Stallion control panels are all extra bonuses that I wasn't even\nfactoring into my search.  Sure, it would be nice to have live support, but\nthat would drive up their costs and prices.  It seems like a fair tradeoff.\nI also did some Google searches about the provider.  The results looked good,\nand their customers seem to like them.  Paraphrasing here, I recall seeing a\npost from someone saying that BuyVM focuses on providing good service at\naffordable prices and that they rely on word-of-mouth instead of advertising.\nSounds good to me, I'll give it a try.\nThe base cost of the plan I chose was only $3.50/month, but that was with no\nbackups.  Adding daily backups was only $0.50/month more, so that was a\nno-brainer.  They also offer DDoS protection, but that would cost another\n$3.00/month.  Since that was nearly the cost of the server itself, it didn't\nseem worth including at this time.\nThe odds of my blog being targeted for a DDoS attack seem infinitesimal for the\nforeseeable future, and I don't see much reason to fret over the possibility of\nbeing down for hours, or even days.  After all, this is a brand-new blog, so\nthere's no audience yet.  If it somehow becomes popular someday, I can always\nadd the DDoS protection later.  ChatGPT agreed.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSome providers claim to have free DDOS protection.  BuyVM charges an extra\n$3.00/month to add DDOS protection.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection is an important feature for web\nhosting providers to offer their customers, as it helps prevent malicious\ntraffic from overwhelming a website or server, leading to downtime and\nperformance issues. Different hosting providers handle DDoS protection in\nvarious ways, and some may offer it as a free service, while others charge\nextra for it.\nWhen a provider offers free DDoS protection, it's usually a basic level of\nprotection that may only be effective against small-scale attacks or the most\ncommon types of attacks. This basic level of protection might be sufficient for\nsome users, but it may not be enough to mitigate more sophisticated or\nlarger-scale attacks.\nBuyVM charges an additional $3.00/month for their DDoS protection, which may\nindicate that they offer a more robust or advanced level of protection compared\nto some of the free options available from other providers. By charging for\nthis service, they might also be able to allocate more resources to their DDoS\nprotection infrastructure, leading to better performance and protection for\ntheir customers.\nWhen choosing a hosting provider, it's essential to consider the type of DDoS\nprotection offered and whether the protection level is adequate for your needs.\nIf your website or application is particularly susceptible to DDoS attacks or\nrequires a high level of protection, it might be worth paying extra for a more\ncomprehensive DDoS protection service.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nTheir additional charge for DDoS protection includes an additional IP address.\nWhy would that be?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen a hosting provider offers DDoS protection with an additional IP address,\nit's typically because the DDoS protection service operates on a separate IP\naddress from your main hosting IP address. This setup provides several\nbenefits:\n\n\nIsolation: By using a separate IP address for DDoS protection, the provider\ncan isolate the traffic destined for your server. The DDoS protection\nservice will filter the incoming traffic on this separate IP address, allowing\nonly legitimate traffic to reach your server. This setup helps maintain the\nstability and performance of your main hosting IP address.\n\n\nRedundancy: Having an additional IP address allows you to switch between the\nprotected IP and your main IP if needed. For instance, if a DDoS attack\ntargets your primary IP address, you can switch to the protected IP address to\nmaintain your website's availability.\n\n\nFlexibility: An additional IP address provides flexibility in managing your\nnetwork resources. You can choose to route specific services or applications\nthrough the protected IP address while keeping other services on the main IP\naddress. This can be useful if you only need DDoS protection for specific parts\nof your infrastructure.\n\n\nEasier management: By separating the DDoS-protected traffic from your\nregular traffic, it's easier to monitor and manage your network resources.\nYou can more accurately measure the effectiveness of the DDoS protection\nservice and make adjustments as needed.\n\n\nIn summary, an additional IP address for DDoS protection helps to isolate and\nmanage traffic more effectively, providing increased flexibility and redundancy\nto ensure your website or application remains available during an attack.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould I worry about DDoS protection at all?  This is just a blog website.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFor a personal blog or a small website, DDoS protection might not be a high\npriority, especially if you're just starting out. DDoS attacks are more\ncommonly targeted at larger businesses, high-profile websites, and those with\ncontroversial content. However, it's essential to be aware that DDoS attacks\ncan happen to anyone, and having some level of protection can be beneficial.\nHere are a few factors to consider when deciding whether to invest in DDoS\nprotection for your blog:\n\n\nTraffic and audience size: If you have a small audience and low traffic, the\nlikelihood of being targeted by a DDoS attack is relatively low. However, as\nyour blog grows and gains more visibility, the risk may increase.\n\n\nNature of your content: If your blog covers controversial topics or attracts\nstrong opinions, there may be a higher likelihood of being targeted by a\nDDoS attack.\n\n\nBudget: DDoS protection services can be an additional expense, and you'll\nneed to weigh the cost against the potential benefits for your blog.\n\n\nHosting provider features: Some hosting providers include basic DDoS\nprotection as part of their standard offerings. If your hosting provider\noffers such protection, you may not need to invest in additional services.\n\n\nIn summary, DDoS protection might not be a high priority for a small blog, but\nit's essential to be aware of the risks and consider the factors above. As your\nblog grows and gains more visibility, you may want to revisit this decision and\nconsider implementing a DDoS protection solution.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I start without DDoS protection and add it after the fact if I get\ntargeted?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can start without DDoS protection and add it later if you get targeted\nor feel the need for increased security. Many hosting providers and third-party\nservices offer DDoS protection that can be added to your existing hosting plan\nwithout requiring any significant changes to your website.\nHowever, it's essential to keep in mind that adding DDoS protection after an\nattack has already started may not be as effective as having it in place\nbeforehand. The time it takes to set up the protection and mitigate the attack\ncould result in prolonged downtime or loss of service for your website.\nIf you're concerned about the potential for DDoS attacks but don't want to\ninvest in protection services upfront, consider choosing a hosting provider\nthat includes basic DDoS protection in their standard hosting plans. This way,\nyou'll have some level of protection from the start without incurring\nadditional costs. As your website grows and the risk of DDoS attacks increases,\nyou can then evaluate whether you need more advanced protection services.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI ordered the VPS server from BuyVM and mentioned some details to ChatGPT.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI'm going to try this KVM VPS from BuyVM/frantech.ca -- which operating system\nwould be best?  CentOS, Debian or Ubuntu?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe choice between CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu depends on your personal\npreferences, familiarity with the operating systems, and the specific\nrequirements of your project. All three are popular and reliable Linux\ndistributions, but they have some differences that may influence your decision:\n\n\nCentOS: CentOS is based on the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)\nand is known for its stability and long-term support. It's often chosen for\nproduction environments, especially when running enterprise applications. If\nyou're looking for a stable OS with a strong focus on security and reliability,\nCentOS is a good choice. However, CentOS tends to have older packages compared\nto Debian and Ubuntu due to its focus on stability.\n\n\nDebian: Debian is known for its robustness and stability, and it's the basis\nfor many other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. It has a vast\nrepository of packages and a strong focus on free software. If you value\nstability and a broad selection of packages, Debian is an excellent choice.\nDebian generally strikes a balance between being up-to-date and stable.\n\n\nUbuntu: Ubuntu is based on Debian and is one of the most popular Linux\ndistributions. It's known for its ease of use, regular updates, and strong\ncommunity support. Ubuntu has a more frequent release cycle compared to CentOS\nand Debian, meaning you'll get newer packages and software more quickly. If you\nprefer a more user-friendly experience and the latest software, Ubuntu is a\ngreat option.\n\n\nIn summary, if you prioritize stability and long-term support, CentOS is a good\nchoice. For a balance between stability and up-to-date packages, Debian is a\nsolid option. If you want a user-friendly experience and the latest software,\ngo with Ubuntu.\nAs a side note, CentOS has shifted its focus to CentOS Stream, a\nrolling-release distribution that serves as an upstream for RHEL. This change\nhas led many users to consider alternatives like Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux,\nwhich aim to provide the same stability and long-term support as the original\nCentOS.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI'll go with Ubuntu.  That's what I use with WSL on my laptop too.  It has a\npart of the configuration page under a section header of \"Configure Server\" and\na label of \"Service Name\" on the input box, which was prepopulated with a value\nof \"SLICE-183963\".  Any idea what this is?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe \"Service Name\" field is likely used by BuyVM/frantech.ca to internally\nidentify and manage your VPS instance. This prepopulated value \"SLICE-183963\"\nis probably an automatically generated name assigned to your new VPS.\nIn most cases, you don't need to worry about this field, and you can keep the\ndefault value. However, you might want to change it to something more\ndescriptive and meaningful to you, especially if you plan to manage multiple\nVPS instances. This can make it easier to identify and manage your VPS\ninstances from the provider's control panel. For example, you could use\nsomething like \"CodeReflectionsBlog\" as the service name to make it more\nrecognizable.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI can probably change this name later?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you should be able to change the \"Service Name\" later through the hosting\nprovider's control panel or customer dashboard. Generally, hosting providers\nallow you to update and manage various aspects of your VPS, including its name,\nfor easier management.\nIf you have any trouble changing the name later or if you're unsure how to do\nit, you can always reach out to the hosting provider's support team for\nassistance.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHere's the details on the VPS plan I ordered:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOkay, I've placed the order for the VPS from BuyVM/frantech.ca.  The product\nname is \"Las Vegas - AMD RYZEN KVM - LV RYZEN KVM 1GB\" and the specs are: 1 GB\nDDR4 RAM, 1 CPU Core @ 3.9 GHz+, 20 GB NVME Storage, 1 IPv4 + /48 IPv6,\n1000Mbit Unmetered BW, DDoS Protection Available, BGP Session Available.  The\nbase price is $3.50 USD per month, and I added the automatic daily backups for\nanother $0.50 USD per month, so the total is $4.00 USD per month.  I didn't\nsign up for the DDoS protection at this time; that would be another $3.00 USD\nper month.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCongratulations on setting up your VPS with BuyVM/frantech.ca! You've chosen a\nVPS plan with a good balance of resources for a personal blog, and the\nadditional daily backups will provide you with peace of mind in case of data\nloss.\nNow that you have your VPS, you can proceed with setting up your preferred\nstatic site generator, comment system, and other necessary tools and services\nfor your blog. If you face any issues or have questions during the setup\nprocess, feel free to ask for assistance.\nGood luck with your new blog, and I hope it becomes a successful platform for\nsharing your programming insights and experiences!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSince this is a KVM VPS, I should be able to easily run any number of Docker\ncontainers, right?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can run multiple Docker containers on your KVM VPS without any issues.\nKVM virtualization provides full virtualization, which means you have an\nisolated environment with its own kernel, allowing you to run Docker and create\ncontainers without restrictions. Just make sure to monitor your resource usage\n(CPU, RAM, and storage) as you add more containers to ensure that your VPS\ncontinues to perform well and doesn't become overloaded.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThus concludes my quest for a server to use for a comment system and whatever\nother purposes come to mind.  Tomorrow, I'll return to the topic of choosing\nthe blogging platform.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/","title":"Searching for a hosting provider..."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/":{"body":"After my initial exploration of blogging\nplatforms and finding a VPS hosting\nprovider, I needed to decide\nwhich blogging platform to use.  ChatGPT continued to assist with the\ndecision-making process.\n\nEarlier in the conversation, ChatGPT mentioned Zola and that it offers Sass\ncompilation out of the box.  I didn't recognize that offhand, so I asked.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou said that Zola offers Sass compilation out of the box. What is Sass\ncompilation?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSass (short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting\nlanguage that extends CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Sass allows developers to\nuse variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making it easier to write\nand maintain complex CSS code. Sass code needs to be compiled into standard CSS\nbefore it can be used by web browsers.\nSass compilation refers to the process of converting Sass code into CSS. This\nis typically done using a build tool or task runner, such as Gulp, Grunt, or\nWebpack. However, some static site generators, like Zola, offer built-in Sass\ncompilation, meaning you don't need to set up a separate build tool or process\nfor it. This can make it more convenient to work with Sass when building a\nwebsite or a blog, as the compilation step is handled automatically by the\nstatic site generator.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould I bother using Sass?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing Sass can be beneficial for your project depending on your requirements\nand familiarity with CSS. Here are some reasons to consider using Sass:\n\n\nMaintainability: Sass allows you to use variables, which can make it easier\nto manage and maintain your stylesheets. For example, you can define colors,\nfont sizes, and other frequently used properties as variables and reuse them\nthroughout your styles.\n\n\nModularization: You can split your Sass code into multiple files and use the\n`@import` directive to include them in the main stylesheet. This can help you\norganize your code better and promote modular design.\n\n\nNested syntax: Sass enables you to nest selectors within one another, which\ncan make your code more readable and easier to maintain by closely mimicking\nthe structure of your HTML.\n\n\nMixins and functions: Sass provides mixins and functions that allow you to\nreuse blocks of code and perform calculations. This can help you write more\nefficient and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.\n\n\nExtensibility: Sass provides advanced features like loops and conditional\nstatements that can help you create complex styles with minimal code.\n\n\nHowever, if your project is small, or you're not familiar with Sass, it may be\nan unnecessary addition. For simple projects, plain CSS might be sufficient.\nAdditionally, learning Sass syntax and setting up the compilation process can\nadd extra complexity to your project.\nIn summary, Sass can be beneficial for larger projects or when you want to\nimprove the maintainability and organization of your styles. However, for\nsmaller projects or when you're less experienced with CSS, sticking to plain\nCSS might be more appropriate.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, sounds useful.  I'll have to keep that in mind.  Meanwhile, I wanted to\ncompare the options ChatGPT previously suggested.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow do Jekyll, Zola and Cobalt compare with each other?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nJekyll, Zola, and Cobalt are all static site generators, but they have some\ndifferences in terms of features, performance, and the languages they are built\non. Here's a comparison of the three:\n\nLanguage and Performance:\n\nJekyll is written in Ruby and uses the Liquid templating engine. It is one\nof the most popular static site generators and has a large community and\necosystem. However, it can be slower in comparison to Zola and Cobalt,\nespecially for larger sites.\nZola is written in Rust and uses the Tera templating engine. Rust is known\nfor its performance, and as a result, Zola can build sites much faster than\nJekyll. This can be a significant advantage for larger projects.\nCobalt is also written in Rust and uses the Liquid templating engine. It\noffers good performance due to Rust but may not be as fast as Zola due to\ndifferences in the templating engine.\n\nFeatures:\n\nJekyll offers a wide range of features, including support for Sass\ncompilation, syntax highlighting, and built-in support for blogging with\npagination. It also has a vast library of plugins and themes, thanks to its\nlarge community.\nZola has a similar feature set to Jekyll but with a focus on performance.\nIt offers built-in support for Sass compilation, syntax highlighting,\ntaxonomies, and pagination. It also has shortcodes and templates for common\ntasks.\nCobalt provides a more minimalistic set of features compared to Jekyll and\nZola. It does not have built-in support for Sass compilation or syntax\nhighlighting but supports blogging and pagination.\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem:\n\nJekyll has the largest community and ecosystem among the three, with a vast\nlibrary of plugins, themes, and resources. It's been around the longest and has\nstrong support from its community.\nZola is gaining popularity but has a smaller community and ecosystem\ncompared to Jekyll. There are fewer themes and plugins available, but the\ncommunity is growing.\nCobalt has the smallest community and ecosystem among the three. It has\nlimited themes and plugins, which might be a drawback if you're looking for\nextensive customization options.\n\nIn summary, Jekyll is a popular choice with a large community and ecosystem,\nbut it may be slower for larger projects. Zola offers better performance and a\nsimilar feature set but has a smaller community. Cobalt is a more minimalistic\noption with fewer features and a smaller community. Choosing between them\nlargely depends on your project requirements, preferred language, and the level\nof community support and customization options you need.\n      \n    \n  \n\nJekyll does sound like a very nice option, but Rust is one of the two languages\nthat I'm most interested in, so I wanted to give one of those options a try.  I\nwasn't familiar with the Liquid templating engine, nor with the Tera templating\nengine.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI don't know anything about the Liquid templating engine.  Tell me about it.\nHow does it compare with Tera?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nLiquid and Tera are both templating engines used to generate HTML content for\nstatic site generators. Here's a comparison between the two:\n\nLiquid:\n\nLiquid is a Ruby-based templating language developed by Shopify. It is used\nin various projects, including Jekyll and Cobalt.\nIt is designed to be simple and easy to learn, with a focus on safety and\nsecurity.\nIt uses a combination of tags, filters, and objects to process and render\ntemplates.\nTags are used for logic and control structures, such as loops and\nconditionals. Filters are used to modify the output of an object, and objects\nrepresent the content being output.\nLiquid is considered safe because it does not allow arbitrary code\nexecution, which can help prevent security vulnerabilities.\nIt has a wide range of plugins and a large community, making it easier to\nfind resources and support.\n\nTera:\n\nTera is a Rust-based templating language inspired by Jinja2 and the Django\ntemplate language. It is used in Zola.\nIt is designed for performance and safety, leveraging the speed of Rust.\nTera uses similar concepts to Liquid, such as tags, filters, and objects,\nto process and render templates.\nIt also supports template inheritance, which allows you to create a base\ntemplate and extend it with child templates. This can help you create more\nmaintainable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.\nLike Liquid, Tera is considered safe because it does not allow arbitrary\ncode execution.\n\n\nComparison:\n\nBoth Liquid and Tera are designed for safety and simplicity, and both use\nsimilar concepts like tags, filters, and objects.\nLiquid has a larger community and a wider range of plugins, thanks to its\nuse in Jekyll and Shopify.\nTera is focused on performance and is written in Rust, which can make it\nfaster in some cases.\nTera supports template inheritance, which can help create more maintainable\nand DRY code.\n\nChoosing between Liquid and Tera depends on the static site generator you\nprefer and the language you are more comfortable with. If you're using Jekyll\nor Cobalt, you'll work with Liquid, whereas if you choose Zola, you'll use\nTera. Both are powerful and safe templating engines that can help you build\nstatic websites efficiently.\n      \n    \n  \n\nTera is implemented in Rust, focused on performance and supports template\ninheritance.  Sounds good to me!  I don't see much reason to use Cobalt, since\nit has the smallest community and ecosystem, and a minimalistic feature set.\nZola seems like the best choice for me, and it has a similar feature set to\nJekyll, but Jekyll is more popular with a larger community and ecosystem.  If I\npick Zola over Jekyll, will I regret it?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWill I lose any important features or functionality if I choose Zola over\nJekyll?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhile both Jekyll and Zola are powerful and feature-rich static site\ngenerators, there are some differences in functionality that you should be\naware of when choosing between the two:\n\nLanguage and ecosystem:\n\nJekyll is written in Ruby and has a large plugin ecosystem, which means you\ncan easily extend its functionality using various plugins developed by the\ncommunity.\nZola is written in Rust, which is known for its speed and safety. However,\nit doesn't have as large of a plugin ecosystem as Jekyll. This means that there\nmight be fewer ready-made solutions for specific use cases, and you may need to\nimplement certain functionality on your own.\n\nTheme availability:\n\nJekyll has a larger community, which has resulted in a greater number of\nthemes available for use. This can make it easier to find a suitable theme for\nyour blog.\nZola has fewer themes available, which means you might need to create your\nown theme or modify an existing one to fit your needs.\n\nHosting options:\n\nJekyll has native support for GitHub Pages, which makes it easy to deploy\nand host your site for free on GitHub.\nZola does not have native support for GitHub Pages, but you can still use\nit with GitHub Pages by generating the static files and pushing them to your\nrepository. This requires an additional step, but it is not overly complicated.\n\nLearning curve:\n\nJekyll uses the Liquid templating language, which might be easier to learn\nfor some users, especially if they have experience with Ruby or other template\nlanguages like Jinja2.\nZola uses the Tera templating language, which is inspired by Jinja2 and\nDjango. While it is still relatively easy to learn, some users might prefer the\nfamiliarity of Liquid.\n\n\nOverall, while Zola may lack some of the extensive plugin ecosystem and theme\navailability of Jekyll, it still offers a powerful and fast static site\ngenerator with a focus on simplicity and performance. If you're comfortable\nwith Rust and don't mind a smaller community and fewer ready-made solutions,\nZola can be an excellent choice. However, if you prefer a larger community, a\nwider range of plugins and themes, and native support for GitHub Pages, Jekyll\nmight be the better option.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre there any Jekyll plugins particularly of special interest that don't have\nequivalents available for Zola?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhile Zola does have built-in features that cover many use cases, there might\nbe some Jekyll plugins with unique functionality that don't have direct\nequivalents in Zola. Some examples include:\n\n\njekyll-admin: This plugin provides a user interface to manage your Jekyll\nsite, including editing content, managing drafts, and previewing changes.\nThere is no direct equivalent for Zola, and you'll need to rely on your text\neditor or other content management tools.\n\n\njekyll-archives: This plugin automatically generates archive pages for your\nJekyll site, such as monthly or yearly archives, tag archives, or category\narchives. Zola has support for taxonomies (tags and categories) out-of-the-box,\nbut it doesn't have built-in support for generating date-based archives.\n\n\njekyll-paginate: This plugin provides pagination functionality for your\nJekyll site. Zola has built-in support for pagination, but the\nimplementation and customization options might differ from those offered by the\njekyll-paginate plugin.\n\n\njekyll-redirect-from: This plugin allows you to easily create redirect pages\nfor changed or moved content. In Zola, you'll need to handle redirects\nmanually, either by creating a custom short code or configuring redirects on\nyour web server.\n\n\njekyll-assets: This plugin helps with asset management, such as CSS,\nJavaScript, and image files. It provides features like asset fingerprinting,\ncompression, and caching. Zola has some built-in features for asset management,\nlike Sass compilation, but it doesn't provide the same level of functionality\nas jekyll-assets.\n\n\nWhile these plugins might not have direct equivalents in Zola, there are often\nalternative solutions or workarounds for achieving similar functionality. If a\nspecific Jekyll plugin is crucial to your project, consider whether the\nfeatures it provides can be replicated in Zola or if sticking with Jekyll might\nbe a better choice for your needs.\n      \n    \n  \n\nNone of these seem like dealbreakers to me.  What about the themes?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCan a Jekyll theme be ported to Zola?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, a Jekyll theme can be ported to Zola, but it requires some manual work.\nJekyll and Zola have different templating engines and folder structures, so\nyou'll need to make adjustments to the theme to make it compatible with Zola.\nHere's a rough outline of the steps involved:\n\n\nFolder structure: Zola has a different folder structure than Jekyll. Create\na new Zola project and reorganize the theme files to fit Zola's folder\nstructure. Mainly, you'll need to move the layout files to the templates\nfolder, and assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images to the static folder.\n\n\nTemplating engine: Jekyll uses the Liquid templating engine, while Zola uses\nTera. You'll need to convert the Liquid templates to Tera templates.\nAlthough both engines share similarities, there are differences in syntax,\nfilters, and tags. Update the template files to use Tera syntax and replace any\nLiquid-specific functionality with Tera equivalents.\n\n\nFrontmatter: Update the frontmatter in the content files to match Zola's\nTOML or YAML format.\n\n\nPagination and taxonomies: If the Jekyll theme uses pagination or taxonomies\n(categories, tags), configure Zola to handle these features. Zola has\nbuilt-in support for pagination and taxonomies, but you'll need to set them up\naccording to the theme's requirements.\n\n\nPlugins: If the Jekyll theme relies on any plugins, you'll need to find\nequivalent functionality in Zola or create custom shortcodes or components\nto replicate the plugin features.\n\n\nSass/SCSS: If the Jekyll theme uses Sass or SCSS, you can take advantage of\nZola's built-in Sass compilation. Make sure to update any import paths in\nyour Sass files to match Zola's folder structure.\n\n\nTest and adjust: Once you've made all the necessary changes, test the Zola\ntheme thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected. Make any\nadjustments or bug fixes as needed.\n\n\nPorting a theme from Jekyll to Zola can be a time-consuming process, but it\nallows you to use your preferred theme with the benefits of Zola's features and\nperformance.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, I'd rather not start out by trying to port a theme, but it's a\npossibility to keep in mind.  But what is this SCSS?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat is SCSS?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSCSS (Sassy CSS) is a syntax for Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets),\nwhich is a CSS preprocessor. It extends the capabilities of CSS by introducing\nfeatures like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more. SCSS aims\nto make working with CSS more maintainable, structured, and efficient.\nSCSS is similar to CSS in terms of syntax and uses curly braces and semicolons,\nwhich makes it easier for developers familiar with CSS to adapt to. Here's a\nquick comparison of CSS and SCSS:\nCSS:\n.navigation {\n  background-color: #333;\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.navigation a {\n  color: white;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  padding: 5px;\n}\n\nSCSS:\n$bg-color: #333;\n$link-color: white;\n\n.navigation {\n  background-color: $bg-color;\n  padding: 20px;\n\n  a {\n    color: $link-color;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n}\n\nIn the SCSS example, we use variables ($bg-color and $link-color) to store\ncolor values and nested rules for .navigation a. These features make it easier\nto maintain and organize your styles.\nWhen SCSS is compiled, it generates standard CSS that browsers can understand.\nUsing tools like Zola or other build systems, you can easily integrate SCSS\ncompilation into your development workflow.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSounds useful.  I figured this question was a long shot:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs there any automated tool to convert Liquid templates to Tera?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere isn't a dedicated automated tool to directly convert Liquid templates to\nTera templates. Since Liquid and Tera have differences in syntax and\nfunctionality, it's difficult to create a fully automated conversion tool that\nhandles all possible cases.\nHowever, you can manually convert Liquid templates to Tera templates by\nfollowing these general steps:\n\n\nStudy the differences between Liquid and Tera syntax and understand their\nrespective features.\n\n\nReplace Liquid tags, filters, and expressions with their Tera equivalents.\n\n\nTest the converted templates to ensure they produce the desired output.\n\n\nIt's essential to familiarize yourself with both Liquid and Tera documentation\nto understand how each template language works and make the necessary\nadjustments during the conversion process.\nLiquid Documentation: https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\nTera Documentation: https://tera.netlify.app/docs/\n      \n    \n  \n\nI decided to try Zola, but there was still the comment system to consider.\nThat will be the subject of tomorrow's\npost.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/","title":"Choosing a blogging platform."}},"docInfo":{"https://codereflections.com/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/18/welcome-to-codereflections/":{"body":615,"title":2},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/":{"body":2372,"title":2},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/20/how-the-sausage-is-made/":{"body":4014,"title":2},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/":{"body":4456,"title":3},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/":{"body":1678,"title":3}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
