finding a VPS hosting provider to be able to implement a comment system.  I'll
finish the story of the blogging platform in <a href="/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/">tomorrow's

<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I was leaning towards using a static site generator at this point, but I still
wanted to have a comment system and perhaps other dynamic features, so I
decided to look for a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting provider.</p>

<p>There are some free options available for hosting your self-hosted commenting

providers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Heroku (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.heroku.com/">www.heroku.com</a></strong>): Heroku offers a free
tier, but it comes with limitations, such as limited usage hours and the app
going to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. It might not be ideal for a
production environment, but it's suitable for testing and small projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glitch (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.glitch.com/">www.glitch.com</a></strong>): Glitch is another
platform where you can host small projects and prototypes for free. It also
has limitations on usage and resources, and your app may go to sleep after a
period of inactivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Cloud (<strong><a href="https://codereflections.com/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/www.oracle.com/cloud/free/">www.oracle.com/cloud/free</a></strong>):
Oracle Cloud offers a free tier with limited resources. You can host small
projects on their &quot;Always Free&quot; tier, which includes compute and storage
resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These options can work for hosting a self-hosted commenting system, but be
aware of their limitations. As your blog grows and traffic increases, you may
need to upgrade to a paid plan or switch to another hosting provider to ensure
better performance, stability, and support.</p>
<p>Remember that the options mentioned above are subject to change, and it's
always a good idea to research the latest offerings and terms of service for
each provider.</p>

<p>Free options are great, but I wanted more flexibility and fewer limitations, so
I wanted to explore the paid options as well.  However, I didn't want to drive
up the cost of this project unnecessarily, just on general principle.  Rather
than just choosing one of the most obvious options (such as AWS), I wanted to
look for the most affordable reasonable option I could find.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">www.digitalocean.com</a></strong>):

<p>Hetzner Cloud (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/">www.hetzner.com/cloud</a></strong>):

</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of cost-efficient hosting providers. Keep in mind
that each provider's features, performance, and customer support can vary. It's
essential to research and choose the provider that best fits your needs and

additional IP addresses, or data transfer overages.</p>

<p>I was concerned about the possibility of a DDoS attack causing excessive
traffic, exceeding bandwidth limits, and causing unlimited additional costs for
bandwidth overages.  As such, I preferred to find a flat-rate option which
wouldn't have a risk of bandwidth overage charges.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>It's difficult to find hosting providers that offer truly unlimited bandwidth
for a flat rate. Most providers have fair usage policies or restrictions in
place to prevent abuse of resources. However, some hosting providers market
their plans as offering &quot;unlimited&quot; bandwidth, although there might still be
limitations or restrictions in place. Here are a couple of options you can
consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>DreamHost (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">www.dreamhost.com</a></strong>): DreamHost
offers shared hosting plans with unlimited bandwidth, starting at
$2.59/month.  However, shared hosting might not be suitable for self-hosting a
commenting system, as the performance may not be as good as a VPS.
Additionally, their VPS plans, which start at $10/month, come with unlimited
bandwidth as well, but they do have a fair usage policy in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hostinger (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.hostinger.com/">www.hostinger.com</a></strong>): Hostinger
offers shared hosting plans with unlimited bandwidth, starting at
$1.39/month.  Like DreamHost, shared hosting might not be the best option for
self-hosting a commenting system. Hostinger's VPS plans start at $3.95/month
and come with a specific amount of bandwidth, not unlimited.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's essential to read the provider's terms of service and fair usage policies
to understand the limitations and restrictions that may apply to &quot;unlimited&quot;
bandwidth. Generally, VPS or cloud hosting providers offer specific data
transfer limits based on the plan you choose. If you expect high traffic on
your blog, it's better to choose a plan with a higher data transfer limit or
consider providers with scalable pricing based on actual usage.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Shared hosting plans didn't sound like a great option.  These might offer
&quot;unlimited&quot; bandwidth, but the limitations didn't sound appealing, so I tried
explaining more clearly what my goal was.</p>

policies. Here are two providers that are known for their generous resource
allocations and flat-rate pricing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>DreamHost (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">www.dreamhost.com</a></strong>): DreamHost's
VPS plans, which start at $10/month, come with unlimited bandwidth, but they
do have a fair usage policy in place. While they don't explicitly mention
throttling, their policy focuses on preventing abuse of resources. In general,
DreamHost has a reputation for being lenient with their usage policies, making
it a good choice for flat-rate pricing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A2 Hosting (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.a2hosting.com/">www.a2hosting.com</a></strong>): A2 Hosting
offers VPS plans starting at $5/month, which include unmetered bandwidth.
They don't explicitly mention throttling, but their policy is centered around
preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage of resources. A2 Hosting is known for
its customer-friendly approach and resource allocations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that the terms and policies may change, and every
provider handles usage differently. Always read the provider's terms of service
and fair usage policies to understand the limitations and restrictions that may
apply. Reach out to their customer support if you need clarification on their
policies or have specific requirements.</p>

<p>When I looked at the DreamHost website, I saw another option for their

<p>Easy installation: DreamHost makes it easy to install and set up WordPress

<li>
<p>Automatic updates: DreamHost automatically updates the WordPress core and

<p>Of course, I wasn't relying on ChatGPT alone here.  During this conversation, I
was also using Google and DuckDuckGo to search for good options too.  One of
the pages I found was a TechRadar article titled
&quot;<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.techradar.com/versus/unlimited-vs-metered-vs-unmetered-bandwidth-hosting">Unlimited vs. metered vs. unmetered bandwidth hosting</a>&quot;.
After reading this article, I realized that I should be searching for
&quot;unmetered&quot; bandwidth rather than &quot;unlimited&quot; bandwidth as the better option.</p>
<p>When I started searching for unmetered options, I found this LowEndBox blog
post titled &quot;<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://lowendbox.com/blog/a-2gb-vps-with-unmetered-bandwidth-for-1-a-month/">A 2GB VPS with Unmetered Bandwidth for $1 a
Month?!?!?</a>&quot;.
This post talked about a cheap VPS with 2GB RAM, KVM, 20GB SSD SATA, unmetered
100Mbps traffic and DDoS protection for $0.97/month.  Of course, this was only
an introductory price; after the first 12 months, it would cost $4.20/month,
which still sounded like a decent option.</p>
<p>I wasn't familiar with this <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://lowendbox.com/">LowEndBox</a> website, but
this is their description of the site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LowEndBox is dedicated to helping people run websites and services on low end
dedicated servers and cheap virtual private servers, where you only need to
pay a few dollars a month. Our mission is to help people find cheap vps
hosting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This certainly sounds like a good resource to keep in mind for anyone looking
for a cheap VPS!</p>
<p>I also found another great website to help with the search for a good but cheap
VPS for this project, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.serverhunter.com/">Server Hunter</a>, which
lets you search through a huge list of server offers while filtering the offers
every way you could imagine: product type (dedicated/hybrid/VPS), pricing,
provider, processor, memory, storage, network, software, virtualization type,
location and other features.  This was an excellent resource.</p>
<p>I searched on Server Hunter for VPS offers with a dedicated IPv4 address and
unmetered bandwidth, and started researching each one starting with the

<p>LXC stands for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtualization technology that
allows multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) to run on a single host.
LXC containers share the same kernel as the host system, which makes them more
resource-efficient and faster than traditional virtual machines (VMs) that
require a separate kernel for each instance.</p>
<p>When a hosting plan shows an &quot;LXC&quot; logo, it means that the provider is using
Linux Containers for virtualization. This can offer better performance and
resource management for your hosted applications and services, as LXC
containers have lower overhead compared to traditional VMs. However, keep in
mind that LXC containers are less isolated from the host system, which could
potentially result in a slightly lower security level compared to full
virtualization.</p>

<p>Yes, LXC containers typically provide root access to the container's
environment. This allows you to have full control over the software and
configuration within the container, as if it were a standalone system. However,
this root access is limited to the container itself and does not grant you root
access to the host system or other containers running on the same host.</p>
<p>It's essential to be cautious when using root access, as it allows you to
perform actions that could potentially harm the container or its data. Always

<p>DigitalOcean does not offer unmetered plans. They charge for bandwidth usage on

your Droplets (virtual private servers) and other services. However, their
pricing model is competitive, and they offer a generous amount of free
bandwidth with each Droplet.</p>
<p>For example, at the time of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the most
basic Droplet plan included 1 TB of free outbound data transfer per month. If
your usage exceeds the free transfer limit, you will be charged for additional
data transfer at a specific rate per gigabyte (which may vary by region).</p>
<p>It's important to note that inbound data transfer to your Droplets is free and
does not count towards your bandwidth usage. Also, data transfer between
Droplets within the same data center is free and not counted towards the limit.</p>
<p>You can monitor your bandwidth usage through the DigitalOcean control panel,

<li>SiteGround: <ul><li>SiteGround offers shared hosting plans with unmetered

from trusted sources before making a final decision.</p>
<p>As a comparison platform, ServerHunter.com seems to have a positive reputation
and has been mentioned in several online articles and forums related to web
hosting. However, it's still essential to do your own research and use multiple
sources when evaluating hosting providers and their plans.</p>

<p>BuyVM, a part of the FranTech Solutions group, is a web hosting provider known
for its affordable and reliable hosting services. They offer a range of hosting
solutions, including Virtual Private Servers (VPS), dedicated servers, and
shared hosting. Here are some key points about BuyVM and FranTech Solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Founded in 2010: FranTech Solutions, the parent company of BuyVM, has been
in the hosting industry for over a decade, which indicates a level of
stability and experience in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affordable hosting options: BuyVM is known for its budget-friendly VPS
hosting plans, which cater to different needs and requirements. They offer
various packages with different resource allocations, making it easy for
customers to choose a plan that suits their specific needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KVM virtualization: BuyVM uses KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
virtualization technology for its VPS hosting. KVM provides better isolation
and performance compared to some other virtualization technologies, allowing
for a more stable hosting environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SLA-backed uptime: BuyVM offers a 99.9% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA)
for their hosting services, ensuring that customers can expect reliable
service and minimal downtime.</p>
</li>
<li>

United States and Europe, allowing customers to choose a location that best
suits their target audience for better performance and latency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom control panel: BuyVM offers a custom-built control panel called
Stallion, which provides users with an easy-to-use interface to manage their
hosting services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer support: BuyVM provides customer support through email and a ticket
system. While they do not offer live chat or phone support, they have a
reputation for providing timely and helpful responses to customer inquiries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, BuyVM is a reputable hosting provider known for its affordable VPS
hosting plans and reliable service. As with any hosting provider, it's
essential to research and read user reviews to get a better understanding of
their service quality and customer support.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>

</div>
<p>We have a winner!  Affordable prices on good plans with full KVM virtualization
from a well-established, reputable provider?  Great!  The SLA, data center
options and Stallion control panels are all extra bonuses that I wasn't even
factoring into my search.  Sure, it would be nice to have live support, but
that would drive up their costs and prices.  It seems like a fair tradeoff.</p>
<p>I also did some Google searches about the provider.  The results looked good,
and their customers seem to like them.  Paraphrasing here, I recall seeing a
post from someone saying that BuyVM focuses on providing good service at
affordable prices and that they rely on word-of-mouth instead of advertising.
Sounds good to me, I'll give it a try.</p>
<p>The base cost of the plan I chose was only $3.50/month, but that was with no
backups.  Adding daily backups was only $0.50/month more, so that was a
no-brainer.  They also offer DDoS protection, but that would cost another
$3.00/month.  Since that was nearly the cost of the server itself, it didn't
seem worth including at this time.</p>
<p>The odds of my blog being targeted for a DDoS attack seem infinitesimal for the
foreseeable future, and I don't see much reason to fret over the possibility of
being down for hours, or even days.  After all, this is a brand-new blog, so
there's no audience yet.  If it somehow becomes popular someday, I can always
add the DDoS protection later.  ChatGPT agreed.</p>

<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection is an important feature for web
hosting providers to offer their customers, as it helps prevent malicious
traffic from overwhelming a website or server, leading to downtime and
performance issues. Different hosting providers handle DDoS protection in
various ways, and some may offer it as a free service, while others charge
extra for it.</p>
<p>When a provider offers free DDoS protection, it's usually a basic level of
protection that may only be effective against small-scale attacks or the most
common types of attacks. This basic level of protection might be sufficient for
some users, but it may not be enough to mitigate more sophisticated or
larger-scale attacks.</p>
<p>BuyVM charges an additional $3.00/month for their DDoS protection, which may
indicate that they offer a more robust or advanced level of protection compared
to some of the free options available from other providers. By charging for
this service, they might also be able to allocate more resources to their DDoS
protection infrastructure, leading to better performance and protection for
their customers.</p>
<p>When choosing a hosting provider, it's essential to consider the type of DDoS
protection offered and whether the protection level is adequate for your needs.
If your website or application is particularly susceptible to DDoS attacks or
requires a high level of protection, it might be worth paying extra for a more
comprehensive DDoS protection service.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>When a hosting provider offers DDoS protection with an additional IP address,
it's typically because the DDoS protection service operates on a separate IP
address from your main hosting IP address. This setup provides several
benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isolation: By using a separate IP address for DDoS protection, the provider
can isolate the traffic destined for your server. The DDoS protection
service will filter the incoming traffic on this separate IP address, allowing
only legitimate traffic to reach your server. This setup helps maintain the
stability and performance of your main hosting IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redundancy: Having an additional IP address allows you to switch between the
protected IP and your main IP if needed. For instance, if a DDoS attack
targets your primary IP address, you can switch to the protected IP address to
maintain your website's availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexibility: An additional IP address provides flexibility in managing your
network resources. You can choose to route specific services or applications
through the protected IP address while keeping other services on the main IP
address. This can be useful if you only need DDoS protection for specific parts
of your infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easier management: By separating the DDoS-protected traffic from your
regular traffic, it's easier to monitor and manage your network resources.
You can more accurately measure the effectiveness of the DDoS protection
service and make adjustments as needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, an additional IP address for DDoS protection helps to isolate and
manage traffic more effectively, providing increased flexibility and redundancy
to ensure your website or application remains available during an attack.</p>

<p>For a personal blog or a small website, DDoS protection might not be a high
priority, especially if you're just starting out. DDoS attacks are more
commonly targeted at larger businesses, high-profile websites, and those with
controversial content. However, it's essential to be aware that DDoS attacks
can happen to anyone, and having some level of protection can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Here are a few factors to consider when deciding whether to invest in DDoS
protection for your blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Traffic and audience size: If you have a small audience and low traffic, the
likelihood of being targeted by a DDoS attack is relatively low. However, as
your blog grows and gains more visibility, the risk may increase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nature of your content: If your blog covers controversial topics or attracts
strong opinions, there may be a higher likelihood of being targeted by a
DDoS attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Budget: DDoS protection services can be an additional expense, and you'll
need to weigh the cost against the potential benefits for your blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting provider features: Some hosting providers include basic DDoS
protection as part of their standard offerings. If your hosting provider
offers such protection, you may not need to invest in additional services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, DDoS protection might not be a high priority for a small blog, but
it's essential to be aware of the risks and consider the factors above. As your
blog grows and gains more visibility, you may want to revisit this decision and
consider implementing a DDoS protection solution.</p>

<p>Yes, you can start without DDoS protection and add it later if you get targeted
or feel the need for increased security. Many hosting providers and third-party
services offer DDoS protection that can be added to your existing hosting plan
without requiring any significant changes to your website.</p>
<p>However, it's essential to keep in mind that adding DDoS protection after an
attack has already started may not be as effective as having it in place
beforehand. The time it takes to set up the protection and mitigate the attack
could result in prolonged downtime or loss of service for your website.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about the potential for DDoS attacks but don't want to
invest in protection services upfront, consider choosing a hosting provider
that includes basic DDoS protection in their standard hosting plans. This way,
you'll have some level of protection from the start without incurring
additional costs. As your website grows and the risk of DDoS attacks increases,
you can then evaluate whether you need more advanced protection services.</p>

<p>The choice between CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu depends on your personal
preferences, familiarity with the operating systems, and the specific
requirements of your project. All three are popular and reliable Linux
distributions, but they have some differences that may influence your decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CentOS: CentOS is based on the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
and is known for its stability and long-term support. It's often chosen for
production environments, especially when running enterprise applications. If
you're looking for a stable OS with a strong focus on security and reliability,
CentOS is a good choice. However, CentOS tends to have older packages compared
to Debian and Ubuntu due to its focus on stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debian: Debian is known for its robustness and stability, and it's the basis
for many other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. It has a vast
repository of packages and a strong focus on free software. If you value
stability and a broad selection of packages, Debian is an excellent choice.
Debian generally strikes a balance between being up-to-date and stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ubuntu: Ubuntu is based on Debian and is one of the most popular Linux
distributions. It's known for its ease of use, regular updates, and strong
community support. Ubuntu has a more frequent release cycle compared to CentOS
and Debian, meaning you'll get newer packages and software more quickly. If you
prefer a more user-friendly experience and the latest software, Ubuntu is a
great option.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, if you prioritize stability and long-term support, CentOS is a good
choice. For a balance between stability and up-to-date packages, Debian is a
solid option. If you want a user-friendly experience and the latest software,
go with Ubuntu.</p>
<p>As a side note, CentOS has shifted its focus to CentOS Stream, a
rolling-release distribution that serves as an upstream for RHEL. This change
has led many users to consider alternatives like Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux,
which aim to provide the same stability and long-term support as the original
CentOS.</p>
