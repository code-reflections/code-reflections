<p>For a Zola site, you can consider using privacy-oriented, self-hosted

to consider are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remark42: A lightweight, self-hosted commenting system with Markdown support
and without any tracking features. It's easy to embed into your Zola site
and keeps data on your server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isso: A self-hosted commenting system that is also lightweight and simple to
integrate into a Zola site. It doesn't use third-party trackers and stores
data on your server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commento: A self-hosted, privacy-focused commenting system that is easy to
integrate and manage. It doesn't include any trackers, and you can control
the data storage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These commenting systems can be installed on your server, and then you can
embed them into your Zola site. Remember that you'll need to have a server to
host these systems, as they require server-side components to store and manage
the comments.</p>

<ol>
<li>Remark42:
<ul>
<li>Written in Go.
<li>Supports social login (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) and anonymous
commenting.
<li>Can import and export comments.

<li>Offers moderation tools, like deleting comments.
<li>Provides an upvote/downvote system and comment sorting options.
<li>Can import and export comments.

<li>Provides an upvote/downvote system and comment sorting options.
<li>Can import and export comments.
<li>Has a clean and modern user interface.

<p>All three options are privacy-focused and store the data locally, but they
differ in features and implementation. Your choice will depend on your

<p>While there aren't as many Rust-based commenting systems as there are in other
languages, there are a few options you can consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cactus Comments: Cactus Comments is a federated, self-hosted commenting
system implemented in Rust. It uses the Matrix protocol, a decentralized
communication protocol, for storage and synchronization of comments. This makes
Cactus Comments unique among commenting systems. However, as it is a relatively
new project, it may not have all the features and polish that more established
solutions offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plume: Plume is a federated blogging engine implemented in Rust. While it is
not a standalone commenting system, it includes a built-in commenting
feature. If you decide to use Plume for your blog instead of a static site
generator like Zola, you will get a commenting system as part of the package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lemmy: Lemmy is a Rust-based, federated link aggregation and discussion
platform similar to Reddit. While it is not a dedicated commenting system
for blogs, you could potentially use it to host discussions related to your
blog posts, and then embed or link to those discussions from your blog.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's worth noting that the Rust ecosystem is growing, and new projects may
emerge in the future. However, at this time, Cactus Comments is the primary
Rust-based option specifically focused on providing a self-hosted commenting
system for blogs.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Cactus Comments sounds <strong>very</strong> interesting, since I'm already interested in
the Matrix protocol anyhow.  Definitely an option to consider!</p>
<p>Plume sounds like a tangent.  I've decided to go with Zola already, so I don't
think I'll be using Plume.  Lemmy seems similar, but perhaps a bit more
interesting.</p>
<p>I searched Google for a Rust commenting system also, and found an article about
another comment system as well:</p>

<p>Commentable.rs is a serverless comment system implemented in Rust, as described
in the article you found. The system is built using Rust, AWS Lambda, and AWS
DynamoDB. It is designed to be a lightweight and cost-effective solution for
adding comments to static websites.</p>
<p>To use Commentable.rs, you will need to follow the steps outlined in the
article, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Setting up an AWS account and configuring the AWS CLI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating an AWS DynamoDB table for storing comments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploying the Rust Lambda function to handle comment submissions and
retrieval</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrating the commenting system into your static website using JavaScript</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that while Commentable.rs is an interesting project, it may not be
as feature-rich or actively maintained as some of the more established
commenting solutions mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>If you're comfortable with AWS and prefer a serverless solution implemented in
Rust, you can give Commentable.rs a try. However, if you're looking for a more
established solution with a larger community, you might want to consider other
options like Remark42, Isso, or Commento.</p>

<p>As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Cactus Comments does not support
social login directly. Cactus Comments uses the Matrix protocol for its
backend, so users need to have a Matrix account to comment. Matrix accounts can
be created on various homeservers, and some of these homeservers might support
social login. In that case, users can log in to their Matrix account using
social login and then use the same account for commenting on your site through
Cactus Comments.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the landscape of commenting systems and their features
is always evolving, so it's a good idea to check the Cactus Comments
documentation and updates for the most recent information on supported
features.</p>

<p>Porting either Remark42 or Commento to Rust would be a non-trivial task. You
would need to rewrite the entire codebase in Rust, including translating the

use Remark42 and consider the possibility of porting it later sometime, or
perhaps never!</p>
<p>Still, if I'm hosting a static site elsewhere (such as GitHub Pages), it would
be nice if the comments could be somehow hosted with the site.  Time to explore
that possibility...</p>

<p>Both Remark42 and Commento serve comments dynamically to the clients, which

<p>Your VPS would need to host the commenting system and serve comments directly
to all clients. When a visitor loads your blog post, the static page content is
served from your static site hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages), while the comments
are fetched from your VPS running the commenting system.</p>
<p>This approach has the advantage of keeping your static site generation process

<p>To incorporate comments into the static site itself, you would need to rebuild
your site each time a new comment is added. This can be done with a combination
of a server-side script and a webhooks mechanism. The general process would
look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A user submits a comment through a form on your site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The comment data is sent to your server (VPS), which processes the comment
and stores it in a database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your server triggers a webhook, notifying your static site generator (e.g.,
Zola) to rebuild the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The site generator pulls the latest comments from the database and
incorporates them into the static pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rebuilt site is deployed, now including the new comment(s).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach has its downsides, though. It can be more complex to set up and
maintain, and it might cause delays in comment display, as the entire site must
be rebuilt and redeployed for each new comment.</p>
<p>If you prefer this approach, you could use a combination of existing tools and
custom scripts to achieve it. For example, you could use a headless CMS (like
Netlify CMS) to manage comments and trigger rebuilds via webhooks. Or, you
could build your own custom script to handle comment submissions, store them,
and trigger site rebuilds.</p>
<p>However, considering the potential downsides and complexity, it's generally
more practical to use a dynamic commenting system like Remark42 or Commento,
which separates the comments from the static site generation process and serves
them directly to clients.</p>

<p>The reason HTML and CSS don't have a built-in mechanism for including HTML from

languages, respectively. HTML is designed to structure content, while CSS is
focused on styling the content. Neither language was designed to manage dynamic
content loading or communication with external resources.</p>
<p>Historically, incorporating external content or executing logic required the
use of a scripting language like JavaScript, which is specifically designed for
such tasks. JavaScript allows you to make AJAX requests to fetch external
content, process it, and then insert it into the DOM. This provides a more
flexible and powerful way to manage dynamic content, including loading content
from external sources.</p>
<p>If you want to include an HTML snippet from another source without using
JavaScript, you can use server-side languages, such as PHP or Python, to fetch
the external content and embed it in your HTML before serving it to the user.
However, this approach is not purely HTML/CSS-based and requires a server-side
processing step.</p>
<p>In summary, HTML and CSS were not designed to handle dynamic content loading or
external resource fetching. These tasks are better suited for JavaScript or

flexibility.</p>

<p>You're right that HTML has evolved over the years, and there have been attempts

One such approach was the HTML Imports specification, which was part of the Web

been deprecated.</p>
<p>The current recommended approach to create reusable components is to use
JavaScript frameworks or libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js. These tools
provide powerful and flexible ways to build reusable components, manage state,
and handle user interactions. They leverage JavaScript to dynamically load and
render content, making it easier to build complex and interactive applications.</p>
<p>However, if you're looking for a more lightweight, HTML-based solution, you can
use the <strong>`&lt;template&gt;`</strong> element in combination with JavaScript to create
reusable components. The <strong>`&lt;template&gt;`</strong> element allows you to define a
reusable piece of markup that can be cloned and inserted into the document
using JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another solution is to use server-side templating engines like Jinja,
Handlebars, or Liquid, which can handle template substitution and partials
before serving the HTML to the user.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that native HTML templating and component features might

<p>Git repository bloat can become a concern if you're constantly updating and
committing large files or making frequent changes to your pages. This can lead
to a larger repository size, slower cloning times, and increased storage
requirements. However, for a blog with comments, the impact is likely to be
minimal, as the text content of comments is typically small.</p>
<p>If you're worried about repository bloat, there are some strategies to mitigate
the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Git Large File Storage (LFS):</strong> If you have large files (e.g., images,
videos, or other binary files) that change frequently, you can use Git LFS
to store these files more efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Git history cleanup:</strong> You can perform periodic maintenance on your
repository using tools like <strong>`git filter-branch`</strong> or <strong>`BFG
Repo-Cleaner`</strong> to remove unused large files, reduce the number of commits, or
remove sensitive data from your Git history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shallow clones:</strong> If you're concerned about cloning times, you can use
shallow clones (<strong>`git clone --depth 1`</strong>) to fetch only the latest commit
history, which reduces the amount of data being transferred.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a typical blog, though, these measures might not be necessary. The increase
in repository size due to text-based comments is likely to be manageable. If
you start noticing issues with repository size or performance, you can consider
the strategies mentioned above.</p>

Remark42 provides a RESTful API that you can use to fetch the comments for a

</span></code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Parse the JSON and convert it to HTML:<br>
Once you have the JSON data with the comments, you can parse it using a script
(e.g., Python, JavaScript/Node.js) to iterate through the comments and convert
them into the desired HTML structure. You can use any HTML structure and CSS
classes that fit your website design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace or insert comments in the static HTML page:<br>
Open your static HTML page and locate the appropriate section where you want to
insert the comments. You can use a placeholder or an HTML comment as a marker.
Your script should then replace or insert the generated HTML with the comments
at the correct location in the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update and push changes to your repository:<br>
After updating the static HTML page with the new comments, commit the changes
to your Git repository and push the changes to the remote repository (e.g.,
GitHub Pages).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that this approach requires you to manually run the script each time a
new comment is added. Alternatively, you can automate the process using a
server-side script, webhook, or a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fetch
new comments and update your static pages automatically.</p>
<p>While this solution allows you to incorporate comments as static HTML, it might

</span></code></pre>
<p><li>

Add a JavaScript function to check for the presence of the bait element:<br>
In your JavaScript file or within a <strong>`&lt;script&gt;`</strong> tag, add the following
function to check if the bait element is still in the DOM and visible:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#6c7079;" class="language-javascript "><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="color:#cd74e8;">function </span><span style="color:#5cb3fa;">checkAdBlock</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">() {
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">  </span><span style="color:#cd74e8;">const </span><span style="color:#eb6772;">adsBox </span><span style="color:#adb7c9;">= </span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">document.</span><span style="color:#5ebfcc;">querySelector</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">(</span><span style="color:#9acc76;">&#39;.adsbox&#39;</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">);
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">  </span><span style="color:#cd74e8;">if </span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">(</span><span style="color:#adb7c9;">!</span><span style="color:#eb6772;">adsBox </span><span style="color:#adb7c9;">|| </span><span style="color:#eb6772;">adsBox</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">.</span><span style="color:#eb6772;">offsetHeight </span><span style="color:#adb7c9;">=== </span><span style="color:#db9d63;">0 </span><span style="color:#adb7c9;">|| </span><span style="color:#eb6772;">adsBox</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">.</span><span style="color:#eb6772;">offsetWidth </span><span style="color:#adb7c9;">=== </span><span style="color:#db9d63;">0</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">) {
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">    </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5f697a;">// AdBlock is enabled, show a message or execute custom code
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">    </span><span style="color:#f0c678;">console</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">.</span><span style="color:#5ebfcc;">log</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">(</span><span style="color:#9acc76;">&#39;AdBlock detected.&#39;</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">);
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">  } </span><span style="color:#cd74e8;">else </span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">{
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">    </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5f697a;">// AdBlock is disabled, proceed as usual
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">    </span><span style="color:#f0c678;">console</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">.</span><span style="color:#5ebfcc;">log</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">(</span><span style="color:#9acc76;">&#39;No AdBlock detected.&#39;</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">);
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">  }
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">}
</span></code></pre>
<p><li>

Call the <strong>`checkAdBlock()`</strong> function:</p>
<p>Invoke the <strong>`checkAdBlock()`</strong> function, preferably after the DOM content
has loaded:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#6c7079;" class="language-javascript "><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="color:#abb2bf;">document.</span><span style="color:#5ebfcc;">addEventListener</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">(</span><span style="color:#9acc76;">&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">, </span><span style="color:#eb6772;">checkAdBlock</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">);
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code checks for the presence and visibility of the bait element when the
page loads. If the element is not found or is hidden, it assumes that an ad
blocker is enabled and logs a message to the console.
</ol>
</p>
<p>In this example, we're just logging a message to the console, but you can
replace that part with custom code to display a message to the user, asking
them to disable their ad blocker or support your site in another way. Keep in
mind that some ad blockers might also block scripts that detect ad blockers, so
your detection method might not always be 100% effective.</p>
