            <p>Continuing the origin story of this blog, after a long conversation with
ChatGPT, I had settled on a name and was lucky enough to be able to register
the &quot;codereflections.com&quot; domain.  Next, I had to choose a blogging platform
and hosting platform.  Should I use WordPress or something else?  I needed to
do some research and think about this decision.  ChatGPT was happy to help.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>The need to choose a blogging platform was mentioned in ChatGPT's response to
my very first message in the conversation about starting this blog.  Here is
that initial exchange; it was immediately followed by the lengthy ChatGPT
conversation quoted in <a href="/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/">yesterday's post</a> about
the search for a name for the blog:</p>

<li>
<p>Plan your content:<br>

<p>Yes, the response was truncated in the middle of the sentence like that, but I
didn't ask ChatGPT to repeat it, so I don't know what the rest of the response
was meant to be.  I've found message truncation like this to be a fairly common
problem with the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chat.openai.com/">chat.openai.com</a> ChatGPT platform.
Responses from ChatGPT which exceed 2048 bytes in length are truncated.  It's
possible to work around it, but this rather small length limit is definitely a
nuisance.  (I'm using ChatGPT Plus; this conversation was using the GPT-4
model.)</p>
<p>Near the end of the conversation about names, ChatGPT mentioned the blogging
platform again:</p>

<p>Obviously, WordPress is the 800-pound gorilla in the room.  It's what everyone
seems to recommend and what most people seem to use.  According to
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>, &quot;42% of the web is built on
WordPress.&quot;  I don't know how accurate that is, but there are probably tens of
millions of WordPress blogs out there.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are a lot of good reasons to consider using WordPress, and maybe
I'll have a compelling reason to use it in the future.  For now, I'm avoiding
using WordPress.  It's written in PHP, which is a language I really dislike.
It's also a dynamic website, so the performance could be slow.  Despite being
able to theoretically use WordPress for free, it does appear to have a lot of
potential costs associated with it.  I won't rule it out for the future, but I
didn't want to start with WordPress, so I steered the conversation away from
that option.</p>

<p>Yes, there are some static site generators and blogging platforms implemented
in Rust. Some popular options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Zola (<strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.getzola.org/">https://www.getzola.org/</a></strong>): Zola is a fast static site generator

<p>Using a static site generator can have some limitations compared to a dynamic
content management system like WordPress. However, for a programming blog, a
static site generator is often more than enough to meet your needs. Some points
to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Performance: Static site generators create pre-rendered HTML files, which
leads to faster load times and a better user experience. You don't need to
worry about server-side rendering, as the files are served directly to the
user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security: Since static sites don't rely on a database or server-side
processing, they are less prone to security vulnerabilities like SQL injections
and other attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintenance: Static site generators require less maintenance and updates
compared to dynamic CMS platforms. You don't need to worry about updating
plugins, themes, or the platform itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost: Hosting static sites is often cheaper and easier because you don't
need a complex server infrastructure. You can use platforms like GitHub
Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, which offer free hosting for static sites.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there are some limitations to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dynamic features: Implementing features like real-time comments, search, or
user accounts can be more challenging with static sites. However, you can still
integrate third-party services like Disqus for comments or Algolia for search
functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content updates: With static site generators, you need to rebuild and
redeploy your site every time you make changes or add new content. This can be
a bit time-consuming, especially for larger sites. However, this is usually not
an issue for personal blogs with occasional updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning curve: If you're not familiar with the static site generator's
syntax, templating language, or build process, there may be a learning curve
involved.  However, this can also be an opportunity to learn new technologies
and improve your skills.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, a static site generator may have some limitations, but for a
programming blog, it can be an excellent choice. It offers simplicity,
performance, and security benefits that can outweigh the limitations,
especially if you're willing to work around them or use third-party services to
enhance your site's functionality.</p>

<p>Jekyll is not the only option for free hosting on GitHub Pages. You can use
other static site generators as well, such as Hugo, Gatsby, 11ty, Hexo, or
Pelican, to name a few. The key is to generate the static HTML files that you
can then host on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Yes, you can still monetize a blog hosted on GitHub Pages. Monetization
options, such as running ads, promoting affiliate products, or offering
sponsored content, are not tied to the hosting platform but rather to the
content and structure of your site. Some common monetization methods for static
sites include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Affiliate marketing: You can join affiliate programs and include affiliate
links in your blog posts. When users click on these links and make a purchase,
you'll earn a commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display ads: You can sign up for an ad network like Google AdSense and
display ads on your site. You'll earn revenue based on the number of
impressions or clicks the ads receive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sponsored content: You can collaborate with companies or other content
creators to create sponsored blog posts, reviews, or tutorials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell digital products or services: You can create and sell ebooks, online
courses, or offer consulting services related to your blog's niche.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donations or memberships: You can ask your audience for support through
donations using platforms like Patreon, Ko-fi, or by offering premium content
or access to a members-only community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To implement these monetization methods, you'll need to add the necessary HTML,
JavaScript, or third-party integrations to your static site generator's
templates or content files. This can usually be done with most static site
generators, including those that can be hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>GitHub does not have specific terms of service prohibiting the monetization of
a blog hosted on GitHub Pages. According to their terms of service, GitHub
Pages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages.</p>
<p>However, there are some guidelines you should follow to ensure that you comply
with their terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages should not be used for commercial purposes, like running an
online store. Monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or sponsored content is
generally acceptable, as long as the primary purpose of your blog is to provide
content and not solely to generate revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages should not be used for hosting activities that violate the
GitHub Acceptable Use Policies, such as distributing spam, hosting illegal
content, or engaging in activities that interfere with the operation of
GitHub's services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages sources must be stored in a public repository, so be mindful of
the content you store and the privacy of any sensitive information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't overuse resources. GitHub Pages is a free service, and excessive use
of resources could potentially result in throttling or suspension of your site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with GitHub's Terms of Service
and Acceptable Use Policies to ensure that you are in compliance. If you are
ever unsure about whether your blog's monetization strategy complies with
GitHub's terms, you can always reach out to their support team for
clarification.</p>
<p>Remember that if you ever feel limited by GitHub Pages or concerned about
compliance, there are other free or affordable hosting options available, like
Netlify or Vercel, that can also host static sites generated with Jekyll or
other static site generators.</p>

<p>GitHub Pages is designed to handle a reasonable amount of traffic for personal,

extremely high levels of traffic, like those of a popular commercial website.
In practice, most personal blogs and projects hosted on GitHub Pages do not
experience any issues with traffic.</p>
<p>If your blog becomes very popular and starts to receive a large amount of
traffic, GitHub may throttle or limit the resources allocated to your site. In
such a case, you might need to consider moving to a different hosting provider
that can better accommodate your needs.</p>
<p>Alternatives like Netlify or Vercel are well-suited to handle higher levels of
traffic for static sites, and they offer free plans with generous resource

<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> If you plan on collaborating with others on your blog,

<p>Ultimately, the decision to create a separate GitHub account for your blog

you can continue using your existing account.</p>

<p>Creating an organization account can be a good idea for your blog project,

organization account:</p>
<ol>

<p><strong>Team management:</strong> Organizations in GitHub allow you to manage teams and
their permissions easily. You can create different teams with specific
access levels and invite collaborators as needed.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Repository management:</strong> An organization account can have multiple
repositories, which can be helpful if you have related projects for your
blog, such as themes, plugins, or additional resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Centralized billing:</strong> If you decide to upgrade to a paid plan for your
blog or other related repositories, organization accounts provide
centralized billing for all associated repositories.</p>

<p><strong>Professional appearance:</strong> An organization account can give your blog a
more professional appearance, as it separates your blog project from your
personal GitHub account.</p>

<p>However, if you're just starting out and don't expect to collaborate with
others or manage multiple repositories, using a regular user account may be
sufficient. You can always create an organization later if your needs change.

<p>It's unlikely that GitHub would delete the inactive account just to free up the

trademark owner to file a complaint for the release of a username, and even

&quot;codereflections&quot;, such as &quot;code_reflections&quot;, &quot;codereflectionsblog&quot;, or
&quot;thecodereflections&quot;. This way, you'll still have a name closely related to

<p>Yes, there are several standard design layouts that you can use as a starting

This layout takes into account the natural reading pattern of users, where they
tend to read content in an F-shaped pattern, scanning horizontally across the
top, then down the left side and across the middle.</p>
<p>Here's a basic structure for an F-shaped layout:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Header: Include your blog's logo, navigation menu, and potentially a search
bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main Content Area: This is where your blog posts will appear. Use a clear
and easy-to-read font with appropriate line spacing. You can choose to display
your posts in a single column or a grid format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sidebar: Place the sidebar on the right side of the main content area. Include
elements such as a brief author bio, a list of recent or popular posts, social
media links, and potentially an email subscription form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Footer: Use this area to display additional navigation links, a copyright
notice, and any other relevant information or disclaimers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure to use whitespace effectively to separate different sections and
avoid clutter. You can also incorporate responsive design principles to ensure
that your blog looks good on various devices and screen sizes.</p>
<p>Many static site generators, including Jekyll, come with built-in themes that
follow standard design layouts. You can start with one of these themes and then
customize it to match your preferences and branding.</p>

<p>There are several ways to integrate comment support for your Jekyll blog. Since
Jekyll generates static pages, you'll need to rely on third-party services to
handle comments. Here are some popular options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disqus: Disqus is a widely-used commenting platform that's easy to integrate
with Jekyll. To add Disqus to your Jekyll blog, sign up for a Disqus account,
and follow their instructions to obtain the universal embed code.  Then, add
the code to your Jekyll theme's appropriate template file (e.g.,
`<strong>_layouts/post.html</strong>`). You can find more detailed instructions in the
Jekyll documentation:</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Staticman: Staticman is another popular choice for adding comments to static
websites. It allows you to have comments as part of your repository, so
they're stored as data files alongside your site's content. This provides the
benefit of full control over your comments and the ability to style them using
your site's CSS. To set up Staticman, follow the instructions provided in the
Staticman documentation:</li>

<li>Commento: Commento is a lightweight, privacy-focused commenting system that
can be easily integrated into a Jekyll blog. Sign up for a Commento account,
and follow their instructions to get the embed code. Then, add the code to the
appropriate template file in your Jekyll theme.</li>

<p><strong><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://commento.io/">https://commento.io/</a></strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Utterances: Utterances is a commenting system that uses GitHub issues to
store comments. It's a great option if you're already using GitHub to host
your blog. To set up Utterances, follow the instructions on their GitHub page:</li>

the one that best fits your needs and preferences. Remember to follow the
instructions provided by each service and test the integration to ensure a
smooth user experience.</p>
